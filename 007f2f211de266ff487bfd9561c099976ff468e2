      "message": "It made issue investigations a little easier since you could just search for the email when looking at the git history, but I guess you can find git commands to also search for the email in the diffs. So removing it should be fine, but since the email is still present in the diffs it also means that you don\u0027t gain that much by removing them from the commit message.",

Since the email for the external ID is stored as plain text, you will still be able to see the email from the commit content.\n\nI think the problem is that \"touched\" includes \"deleted\", so what happens is that we delete the external ID to remove the email address, but then persist the very same email address in the commit message.\n\nIf we stop persisting the email in commit N, then IIUC GC-ing up to and including commit N-1 will make the email inaccessible, or is that not the case?",
