      "message": "Won\u0027t this also add [OUTDATED] to the end of the change?\n\nAlso, while this table is probably only used for the changescreen now, it was originally also used on the ChangeList screen.  When Shawn started with the REST api stuff I think he just copied the old ChangeTable and renamed it ChangeTable2.  But I suspect that the intent is to merge them again, so we probably need some way to signal that abandoned changes should be highlighted.  I kinda wonder if it wouldn\u0027t be possible to merge these 2 again by making one inherit from the other to help prevent further diverging?",

      "message": "Right, the \u0027[OUTDATED]\u0027 should not be shown for abandoned changes. I have fixed this with the new patch set.\n\nI agree to your concern about diverging of ChangeTable and ChangeTable2. It would be definitely good to merge them, but I\u0027m not sure how much effort this would be. I would not like to address this right now because I\u0027m busy with other stuff, but yes, we should not forget about it.",

      "message": "I am, of course, fine with the two not being merged for this change, but I don\u0027t think it is a good idea to assume that abandoned changes should be highlighted in this widget because it feels like an assumption the widget should not make.  To avoid this, perhaps this alteration could be done by overriding this method in an anonymous extension of this class when embedded in the Dependencies table?  A more complicated solution would be to have some method which sets the statuses to be highlighted.\n\nAnother thing to consider which might make this even harder is that we probably should not highlight abandoned changes in the needed-by section(do they even appear there)!",
