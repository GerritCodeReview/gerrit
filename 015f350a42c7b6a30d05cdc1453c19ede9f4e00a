Let\u0027s imagine we have a setup with 10K users and want to replace the change screen with an alternative implementation for all QA users. If we have 500 QA users this would be a lot of work.\n\nThinking more about the intention of this change it seems like we would need a \"user-type\" property on users. Then, the screen replacement would be defined on the user type level instead of doing that for each particular user.",
