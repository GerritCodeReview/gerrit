      "message": "I added shuffling to reduce memory allocation if the site has a few large and many small repositories. Migrating slices of small repositories needs a lot less memory than migrating the same number of slices of large repositories. Shuffling is an attempt to mix slices from large and small repositories to reduce overall memory allocation so that the number of migration threads can be increased without driving java gc crazy.",

      "message": "It depends, I think on the size distribution of the repositories in the site.\n\nI measured migration speed for our largest repository (10GB, 15mio commits, 1.5mio refs) vs. number of migration threads. Migration speed increased roughly linearly between 1 thread and 15 threads from 50 to 450 changes/s, between 20 and 30 threads migration speed dropped from 400 to 100 changes/s. Above 20 threads Java gc cpu% increased a lot reducing cpu% available for the migration. This site (including 1k other repositories in that site) we migrated using 20 threads, average speed was 120 changes/s.\n\nOn another site (serving 25k repositories) we could migrate using 1 thread/core with 350 cores by skipping one very large repository which fortunately is read-only so we could migrate that in advance on another server. Here migration speed was \u003e1500 changes/s.\n\nI guess this could be improved by using two thread pools instead of shuffling:\n- one smaller thread pool (e.g. 20 threads) to migrate slices of large repositories (e.g. \u003e 1GB)\n- another larger thread pool (1 thread/core - 20) migrating slices from smaller repositories.",

Shuffling also has the downside of reducing cache hits. The best way to limit resource utilization is with a limit of some sorts. Limiting threads is one way to limit RAM utilization, and when one particular project is known to be \"bad\", limiting that particular project can help prevent over limiting other projects. Adding a per project semaphore is likely a better solution than shuffling.",
