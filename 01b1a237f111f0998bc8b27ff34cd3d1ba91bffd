      "message": "Not sure, ChangeHooks.postEvent() allow to send stream events separately from hook so it could be useful for the core as well. I do not see how we could include this in the dev-plugins.txt since this is just another method of a core class that a plugin can use.\n\nLet me know if you feel that this need to be documented in the dev-plugins.txt, I will add it even if I think we are duplicating the documentation, since already documented in the javadoc.",

      "message": "From the commit message I understand that the main purpose of this change is to enable plugins to send stream events. This sounds very useful and many plugins may want to use this. Most plugin authors are not very familiar with the Gerrit internals which is why dev-plugins.txt explains the extension possibilities which are most interesting and provides examples for them. In this document there is already a section that describes how a plugin can listen to events. To me it would be very naturally to also add there a section about how to send events. \n\nOf course there is javadoc, but this is also true for most of the other stuff that is described in dev-plugins.txt.",
