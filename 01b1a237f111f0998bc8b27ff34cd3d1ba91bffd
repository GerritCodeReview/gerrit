I do not see how we could include this in the dev-plugins.txt since this is just another method of a core class that a plugin can use.\n\nLet me know if you feel that this need to be documented in the dev-plugins.txt, I will add it even if I think we are duplicating the documentation, since already documented in the javadoc.",
