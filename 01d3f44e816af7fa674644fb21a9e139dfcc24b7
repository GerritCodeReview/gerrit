      "message": "Looks like this is to guard against using the changeComments property before it\u0027s been initialized. Is that right? I think it would be cleaner and more consistent if this can instead be declared as a dependency in a computed expression.\n\nWe currently already use a chain of computation effects to populate the list of files that get rendered ..\n\nreload() sets _files using _getFiles() \n  ↳ updating _files triggers _computeFilesShown()\n    to set _shownFiles\n      ↳ updating _shownFiles causes the rows to render in the DOM.\n\nWe can avoid this wait method by inserting another layer that depends on the comments. Something like ..\n\n_filesWithCommentedPaths: {\n  type: Array,\n  computed: \u0027_computeFilesWithCommentedPaths(files.*, changeComments, patchRange)\u0027,\n},\n\n.. and then we can feed this one into _computeFilesShown so that the new flow would look like ..\n\nreload() sets _files using _getFiles()\n  ↳ updating _files triggers _computeFilesWithCommentedPaths\n    to set _filesWithCommentedPaths\n      ↳ updating _filesWithCommentedPaths triggers _computeFilesShown()\n        to set _shownFiles\n          ↳ updating _shownFiles causes the rows to render in the DOM.",
