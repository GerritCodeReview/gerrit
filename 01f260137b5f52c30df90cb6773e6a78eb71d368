      "message": "I don\u0027t have a good answer to that as it feels bad if we keep running deletion for changes that were closed some time ago and have their accountPatchReview entries already removed...\n\nI can imagine that we could do the opposite:\nSelect existing change_ids from the accountPatchReview table and evict entries for changes that were closed XXX ago. This way abandoned would not collide with closed - in fact, we could add that as another thing that gets performed when changes get abandoned... or could specify different worker/configuration for it.\n\nAny thoughts on that?",
