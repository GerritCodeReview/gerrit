      "message": "I\u0027m not really sure we should start to add those partial safety measures. AbstractDaemonTest also has some @Before methods. They aren\u0027t final at the moment. Does that mean that they are safe to override? I guess not. By adding final only in LightweightPluginDaemonTest, we could give false signals to other developers. Even if we adjusted all @Before and @After methods of AbstractDaemonTest and LigthweightPluginDaemonTest, I could apply a similar reasoning to other methods in AbstractDaemonTest like initSsh().",
