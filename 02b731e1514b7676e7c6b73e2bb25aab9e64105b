This policy can\nbe implemented much easier a Sempahore with N permits, where N\nis the max allowed concurrency. Both git-over-http and git-over-ssh\nrequests should first obtain a permit from the semaphore, then proceed with the request and release the permit in the end.\n\nWe can also introduce a more explicit configuration option:\n\n  [git]\n    concurrencyLimit \u003d N",
