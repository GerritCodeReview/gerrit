If there is an automated use-case, using the label predicate and a bit of post-processing gets you the same result.\n\nThis would be quite complex to do as indexed predicate, since the actual label names, counts and values are arguments. When I look at the label predicate, I think it has reached its complexity ceiling and not all cases it supports are actually interesting for querying (in the web UI).",
