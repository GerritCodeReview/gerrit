      "message": "Seems like Git does not get that this is forked, which breaks the blame history, and makes this review very complex. How about doing it the other way around: gr-app is what it always was, and gr-app-wrapper or *-setup or *-init or *-host is the thing you fork for init code?",

The dom-module is literally the same.\n\nIf you do it the other way around, then the gr-app-wrapper is difficult  to review.\n\nYou could use a diff tool of your choice as a workaround to see a proper diff.\n\nI think it is better to keep gr-app the same looking from the outside.",

      "message": "I could, but the blame history is still broken. Other idea: Does it get better if we split this commit into multiple, i.e.\n\n1) git cp gr-app to gr-app-element - do not use it, and do not change anything yet - I suppose a cp would not break the blame history?\n2) Make the changes.",
