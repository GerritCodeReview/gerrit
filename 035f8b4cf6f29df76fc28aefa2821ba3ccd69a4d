      "message": "You are referring to the change [1] which is also preserved (applicable) in [2]. However, for this target stable-3.2 branch, that changed code is no longer there in that base: [3]. The reviewerId is no longer set in that send method. Starting from stable-3.2, it is used only in _mapReviewer. That is why the Auto Merge diff shows this automatic resolution ([3]).\n\nNow, there might be a need to redo this fix [1] again in a slightly different way, from this branch upwards. Meaning, maybe reviewerId needs to be a decoded one but from another line in that file. If so, that I think should be a follow-up change based on stable-3.2 and after these merge-ups. Unless it gets decided that another change is needed from downstream, say, if code that is common to all these branches gets amended rather (which would be another solution compared to the original one).\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/280956/-1..1/polygerrit-ui/app/elements/change/gr-reply-dialog/gr-reply-dialog.js\n\n[2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/280957\n\n[3] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/280958/1/polygerrit-ui/app/elements/change/gr-reply-dialog/gr-reply-dialog.js",

      "message": "Sorry I\u0027m not following :/ functionality was moved to \u0027_mapReviewer\u0027 method and I was under impression that fix will be applied there as a part of this merge commit.\n\nWhat\u0027s the point in merging stuff if some (one has no idea which) fixes have to be re-applied again as the follow ups? I mean if I was not reviewing it who would be responsible for capturing that the fix is not applied regardless of what is described in the commit message? IMHO that approach is prone to errors however if that is the way I can issue the follow-up fix for that... which will be later merged-up again to master...",
