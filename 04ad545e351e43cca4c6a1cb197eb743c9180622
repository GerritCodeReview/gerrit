      "message": "Should there be own Capability for seeing private changes as it\u0027s currently the case for DRAFT changes? See line 481 above:\n\n  || getRefControl().canViewDrafts()\n\nIt was discussed in proposal, that one way to achieve adding CI-User(s) to reviewers list, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s practical approach for many Gerrit installation in the wild, that using different users for different CI configurations. So like in draft world, I would expect to be able to assign CanViewPrivate changes global capability to CI group. Another nice side effect of that, would be: I could assign this capability to Registered users, thus allowing all users to see privat changes, in which case, private would not mean private in terms of visibility, but in term of visible work-in-progress changes.",

As result of this the changes in this topic are quite small and cover only single aspects. We must see in the end how to pile up all those changes into a series, before we can merge anything. Also while we work on it all changes in this topic should be considered as WIP :)",
