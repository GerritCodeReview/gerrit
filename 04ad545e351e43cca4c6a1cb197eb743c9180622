      "message": "Should there be own Capability for seeing private changes as it\u0027s currently the case for DRAFT changes? See line 481 above:\n\n  || getRefControl().canViewDrafts()\n\nIt was discussed in proposal, that one way to achieve adding CI-User(s) to reviewers list, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s practical approach for many Gerrit installation in the wild, that using different users for different CI configurations. So like in draft world, I would expect to be able to assign CanViewPrivate changes global capability to CI group. Another nice side effect of that, would be: I could assign this capability to Registered users, thus allowing all users to see privat changes, in which case, private would not mean private in terms of visibility, but in term of visible work-in-progress changes.",

I\u0027m looking into the first changes in this series only. And try (again) explain to someone else and understand better myself, what is going on here? We are marking a change with a bit and try to attach some meaning to this bit. Let put aside the reason for it, and only re-visit the naming: private. Asking thesaurus for assistance for finding the synonyms for this: http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/private reveals the following ideas:\n\n* special\n* individuell\n* own\n* restricted\n\nWhat I\u0027m trying to say. giving better naming for action of marking a change  marking a change with special bit, and allow to do whatever Gerrit users want with it, would open this concept for completely different use cases. So, yes, actually we mark those changes with a bit, http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/mark giving us:\n\n* mark\n* stamp\n\nIOW, when we offer this feature: mark a change with specific bit, and in the same time, allowing that all reviewers and the rest of the world who was granted SpeicialChangeViewCpabaility, why don\u0027t we call those changes stamped or marked, or similar?",
