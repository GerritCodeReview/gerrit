It sets checksPatchset to changeViewState (diffViewState) and this is picked by checks-model which loads checks and show them. If this was not set checks-model was looking only to latestPatchset.\n\nIt looks like we would need something as ported checks for this. If user reloads diff view, checks will disappear. Am I right?",
