      "message": "I think we should ship these fake request and response implementations with gerrit-acceptance-framework, so that plugins can use it. This can be done in follow-up change though. See, for example this change [1], where HTTPD test deps were exposed and real tests can be implemented in plugins. Obviously, we should allow to do the same with fake classes, without forcing plugin authors to copy/paste them.\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/71626",
