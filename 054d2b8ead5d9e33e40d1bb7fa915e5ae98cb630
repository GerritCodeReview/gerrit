      "message": "How are we supposed to identify these?  The dev docs do not mention that we need to not have any eclipse warnings.  Is this really something that we should be requiring if we cannot test for it?\n\nI would like to be a good citizen, but I have to point out that is becoming extremely difficult to contribute and to review Gerrit code with an ever increasing manual style bar.  How is a reviewer supposed to catch stuff without an automated way?  Is that really how we want to waste our time?  I want to start reviewing more code, but it seems like reviewing code now means downloading it, running google-format, eclipse, and buildifier at least.  I am not in favor of enforcing this kind of bar for reviewers.",

      "message": "Yeah, you\u0027re right. I didn\u0027t realize we weren\u0027t already documenting our expectations, sorry about that.\n\nIt looks like it is not hard with bazel to pass -Xlint:* options to javac and treat the resulting warnings as build errors. A first pass looks like there is some noise, so I will try to whittle it down a bit tomorrow. For the automated formatters, we should just add that to GerritForge CI, that won\u0027t be hard.\n\nOf course, there are still some warnings that a human reviewer could feasibly pick up without the aid of a compiler, like usage of raw types :)",
