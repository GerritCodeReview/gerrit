      "message": "You are right, if the instances of this class are not short living only, the implementation of this equals method may return wrong results. I\u0027ve now fixed this by removing the equals, hashCode and compareTo method from this class. They were just here to ensure correct sorting of GroupMembersList instances when they are added to a TreeSet. For this sorting I now explicitly create a comparator when instanciating the TreeSet. This is cleaner as it doesn\u0027t require this equals method here. At the places where we populate the TreeSet\u0027s it is also ensured that no 2 instances of GroupMembersList for the same AccountGroup are added.\n\nAnyway I\u0027ve added some Javadoc for this class.\n\nDone.",
