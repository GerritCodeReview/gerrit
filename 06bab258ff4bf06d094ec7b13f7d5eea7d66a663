      "message": "This is of course wrong. It is a totally WIP and it shouldn\u0027t have been even uploaded, no wonder that all SSH tests are failing: [1]. What I was after but fail to do, is to programmatically switch off Hostkey verification entirely, as you commented on anothrr change in JGit. So instead of doing this:\n\n  // CharSink configFile \u003d Files.asCharSink(new File(sshDir, \"config\"), UTF_8);\n  // configFile.writeLines(Arrays.asList(\"Host *\", \"StrictHostKeyChecking no\"));\n\nfactory builder could offer a syntactic sugar method, a l√°:\n\n   builder.setConfigStoreFactory(new DisableHostKeyVerifierConfigStore())\n\nor similar. The point would be, to do it *without* actually writing any files to the disk.\n\n[1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/794353",

      "message": "Yes, I saw it was WIP, and normally I don\u0027t comment on WIP changes, but since it seemed to me that this was the cause of the exception which you mentioned over in the Eclipse Gerrit, I do so all the same.\n\nAs I said, there\u0027s two ways: either set a no-op ServerKeyDatabase always returning true from its accept(), or set an in-memory config store that has the setting. Currently the no-op ServerKeyDatabase is probably easier; for the config store, we\u0027d need to add some default implementation for that SshConfigStore interface to JGit to make it convenient for users.",
