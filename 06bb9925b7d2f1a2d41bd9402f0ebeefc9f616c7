      "message": "Good point. We should try to avoid different dependency versions pulled from Bazel\u0027s WORKSPACE and package.json. One way to achieve that, we could write bazel sh_test, retrieve the versions from package.json and using bazel query and compare them. Another approach is to talk Bazel team / Angular team. They already have integration with yarn through Bazel tool chain: [1].\n\n* [1] https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs",

Making a shell script testing that seems a bit overkill at the moment though - it would not be sufficient to make that test, I would also need to setup CI to actually run it etc. A lot of work for a temporary issue that should be relatively easy to fix when it happens. I only wish JSON would let me comment...\n\nWhat do you think?",
