For this reason it makes sense for a patch-set-created event to be generated.",

      "message": "Thanks David. I agree with your point about Gerrit knowing which commit is used. However, doesn\u0027t this issue depend on what the purpose of patchset-created is?\n\nOnce the changeid has been merged into the branch the review is closed, so firing patchset-created events after the change has been merged seems of little value (and is causing issues for us as it triggers a CI build for every merged review). Do you have use cases where this event is required/useful?\n\nPerhaps we can define patchset-created as \"A new patchset has been created *which has not been merged*\"?\n\nBTW - We don\u0027t allow force pushes to the branch - only fast-forward merge by the CI server (Jenkins) to a commit fully tested by it. We don\u0027t want the Jenkins Gerrit Trigger to rebuild all merged reviews after the push.",
