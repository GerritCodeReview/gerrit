      "message": "is it possible to use something like `Polymer.RenderStatus` to make sure its attached ? (I am not sure about whether it will work or not, but if the element is attached to the dom, theoretically the `RenderStatus.afterNextRender` should guarantee that its attached).\n\nI think what is concerning me here is the `attached` event here is only for external dependencies and only exist in `gr-diff-cursor`. Maybe use a different event name with some comments on why its introduced and the use case of it will be better for people who don\u0027t have the full context. And also prevent people from deleting it by accident.\n\n\nBTW: we have upgraded to polymer 2, so you probably should start checking documents under `2.0` :)",

      "message": "I indeed was checking docs for 1.0. thanks!\n\nAs far as I could understand from the 2.0 docs `RenderStatus.afterNextRender` will be called after the element is actually rendered in the page - which can be in some cases not relevant as attachment happens before. After attachment the component is as far as I understand already interactable and waiting additional time the actual rendering in the page might not be necessary.\n\nTo be honest I could not understand your suggestion regarding naming very well. Would you prefer an event name like \u0027gr-cursor-attached\u0027? Even if the event \u0027attached\u0027 is not bubbling?",
