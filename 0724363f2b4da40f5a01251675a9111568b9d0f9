      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is a bug.\n\nWe first check if there is a view in Gerrit code with that name. If so, we select that view and never look at the plugin views.\n\nIf there is not, we look at the plugin views and see if we have a match.\n\nThat means that views in core take precedence before plugin views. \n\nNow, there is a bug that plugin views pretend to be core views, but this is about the child collection which is aware that it is a plugin collection and hence not suffering from this bug.\n\nI am also not sure if this is really the behavior that we should encourage for the sake of implementing long-lasting APIs in plugins. I\u0027ll document this in this test to make sure people know what they sign up for.\n\nI am pretty sure that there are plugins that bind child views or maybe even collections that use this to hide the fact that they are a plugin.",

      "message": "I am of the opinion that we should not allow plugins to provide URLs in a way that hides the fact that those URLs came from plugins. Doesn\u0027t matter if the URLs are core endpoints, new top-level collections, new child collections, new views on existing collections, or whatever. They should all have the plugin name in them. You may be right that some plugins are already relying on this behavior. That doesn\u0027t change my opinion about whether it should be allowed in theory, but I admit it does make it harder to change the behavior.\n\nWe don\u0027t need to solve this problem now. Just as long as something is documented, I\u0027m happy.",
