      "message": "As this is a hint for a third-party software, I\u0027m not sure if we\nwant this change in our code base.\n\nWikimedia noted in their upgrade announcement email that people will\nneed git-review \u003e\u003d1.27. Yet still we\u0027re seeing lots of users that\nrun into issues around `ref/publish/...` So we figured it would be\nbest to alert people about the upgrade right when the error occurs,\nand assist them to make sense of Gerrit\u0027s otherwise confusing default\nerror message.\n\nHints are limited to the /refs/publish/... errors, so the rate of\nfalse positives should be low.\n\nBut as git-review is used widely, we\u0027ll run this patch at Wikimedia,\nto help users to help themselves.\n\n(Even if we cannot land this patch in main Gerrit, it might be useful\nfor others)",
