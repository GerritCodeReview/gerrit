      "message": "Optional: Would it make sense to call this getTip() instead (considering that \u0027tip\u0027 in Git is the latest commit on a branch and HEAD is the tip of the currently checked out branch)? I know that it was called getHead() in AbstractDaemonTest but getHead(\"HEAD\") seems kind of strange to me and I would originally have expected to get HEAD from e.g. AbstractDaemonTest#getRemoteHead instead of the tip of the master branch. We can keep getHead() if renaming it to getTip() is too much effort.",
