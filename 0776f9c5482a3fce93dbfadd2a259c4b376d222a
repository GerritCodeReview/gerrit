      "message": "I don\u0027t know much about JavaScript, but AFIK you cannot overload functions in JavaScript, e.g. you cannot have two \u0027put\u0027 functions with a different number of parameters. I was told that the way I did it is a common workaround for this, but I\u0027m open for other proposal. How would I pass an empty JavaScriptObject and how would I detect here that it is empty?",
