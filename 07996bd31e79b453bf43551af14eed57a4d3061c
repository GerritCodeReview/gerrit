      "message": "This loop iterates many times for the same reviewer. Consider someone that scores both +1 code review and +1 verified on a single patch set... you get two iterations for them.\n\nIt also covers every patch set. Consider a change that I constantly say -1 on. 15 iterations later, I am listed 15 times.\n\nI think you want to base your work on a map or something like:\n\n  Map\u003cAccount.Id, Object\u003e reviewers \u003d Maps.newLinkedHashMap();\n  for (...) {\n    if (!reviewers.containsKey(approval.getAccountId()) {\n      reviewers.put(...);\n    }\n  }\n  return reviewers.values();\n\nThe order will be stable with the database iteration order, and you\u0027ll only get one record for each reviewer.",
