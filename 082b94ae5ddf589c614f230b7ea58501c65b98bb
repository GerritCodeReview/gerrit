While working on this fix I noticed that the fix in [1] is broken and we had to revert it [2]. Hence until we have a new solution for [1] I\u0027m abandoning this change.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.git.corp.google.com/c/gerrit/+/354699\n[2] https://gerrit-review.git.corp.google.com/c/gerrit/+/355414",
