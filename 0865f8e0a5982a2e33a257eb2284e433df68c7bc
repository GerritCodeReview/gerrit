      "message": "I don\u0027t think that it is a good idea to allow any sending user to suppress emails, it has a way of defeating the intentions of emails sent by Gerrit.  I think that this feature should be limited, perhaps to users in certain groups?  Adding a \"silence-email\" capability would do this.   This way, (CI) system designers can limit the noise their systems generate if they give thought to it.  They are likely to think about and be consistent (since it is via automation) about which emails they want to silence.  Random users on the other hand, will likely use the feature randomly and this will likely randomly confuse people and result in random (but frequent) tech support requests. :(",

      "message": "Your point is very much sensible! I did not think of that for an end user is more likely to review a change using the web UI rather than with a ssh command, but still.\n\nWhat do you think of the following:\n- adding a global capability \"silence-email\", as you suggested,\n- contrary to other capabilities, it would not use administrate server as a fallback. As I understand your point, the key point is to limit the feature to automated scripts, and administrators does not fall in that category :)\n- as a result, no group will have the capability by default, although it should be hinted in the documentation that Non Interactive Users is likely to have it granted. Either that, or grant silence-email to Non Interactive Users by default (during a schema upgrade ?).\n\nAlso, you speak of \"silence-email\" capability, not \"suppress-mail\" capability. Does it mean you would prefer that the option be called that way too?",
