      "message": "submit action works differently than this flag. The action only appears back from CURRENT_ACTIONS when the rules are fully satisfied, e.g. both Verified+1 and Code-Review+2 are already on the change.\n\nThis submit was true if it was possible for the current user to grant the missing labels. So if the change was missing Code-Review+2 but the current user has permission to grant Code-Review+2 than its true, even though it can\u0027t be submitted unless the user granted +2 as part of this review.\n\nThe new REST API reports a different thing than this expects so I can\u0027t use it here.",
