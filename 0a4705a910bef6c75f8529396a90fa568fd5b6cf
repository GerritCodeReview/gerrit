However, this condition \"someone other than the owner was added\" doesn\u0027t allow the owner to (re-)add themselves in the dialog.\n\n2. It seems, you want to avoid situation when the owner is (re-)added without making any comments/voting/etc...\nI agree that it is nice to have, however there is no indication about it in gr-reply-dialog (i.e. I explicitly adds owner to the attention set, but I can\u0027t click \"Send\" and it is unclear why). At the same time, the owner can be added from the hovercard, so a reviewer can bypass this condition.\nMaybe remove isNotOwnerCondition?\n\nThe same for isNotCurrentUser",
