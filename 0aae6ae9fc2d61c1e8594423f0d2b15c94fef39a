      "message": "Sorry for the confusion, but there was a reason. [1] was specifically about aligning @Nullable in the signature of create with the nullability of the fields in ChangeNotesState itself, and metaId is still @Nullable, so from that perspective it was accurate.\n\nIn this change, we have added a metaId method to Builder which does not take a @Nullable arg, although the underlying field in the ChangeNotesState remains @Nullable. As a result, a caller\u0027s two options for using Builder are either pass a non-null argument to metaId, or don\u0027t call metaId at all. These correspond to ChangeNotesState#{create,empty}.\n\nMaybe it would be clearer if I add an explicit checkNotNull to the body of create, to emphasize that if you\u0027re gonna pass all these arguments, you also need to pass a metaId; I\u0027ve done that in the next PS.\n\nIf you think it would be easier to follow, I can just leave @Nullable here and mark the arg to Builder#metaId @Nullable as well.",
