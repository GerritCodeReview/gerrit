How would you configure that groupA can create template projects under \"A/\" and a groupB can create projects under \"B/\", but not vice versa?",

      "message": "That\u0027s a good point.\n\nWhile our use case could do without this refinement, you are\nright. Such fine grained control over template instantiation certainly\nhas it\u0027s use cases. I\u0027ll give it a shot.\n\nBut I guess that also comes with the problem that determining whether or not to show the \"Create New Project\" menu item is no longer a really cheap operation.",
