      "message": "The newly added test\n`submitTwoWithFastForwardWhereOneAlreadyAvailableInDifferentBranch` from the\npredecessor change shows that this fix is not good. That test will sporadically fail or succeed.\n\nIn this line we are adding `n` to the `sorted` list but we are not hitting `n` by the RevWalk which guarantees the sorting order. We are adding `n` manually here and, depending on the order of elements in the input parameter `toSort` the `n` may or may not end up in the proper place in the `sorted` list.\n\nI still believe that the fix for the Issue 289505276 has to be done in the `RebaseSorter` and that we shall proceed with first implementing a test suite that fully covers the desired behariour of the `RebaseSorter` and then proceed with fixing the issue.",
