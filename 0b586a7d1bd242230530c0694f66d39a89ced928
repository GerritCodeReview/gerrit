      "message": "Comment cards looks good! One final thing, I noticed that username are also added to when a user starts a draft comment.\n\nI suggest we bring the \"Draft\" text closer to the username, please see spacing specs in https://imgur.com/a/L4HJ1sB\nDraft is not exactly the same as the comment snippets, but more like a status and that is why I suggest this placement instead of vertically aligning \"Draft\" like in the screenshot.",
