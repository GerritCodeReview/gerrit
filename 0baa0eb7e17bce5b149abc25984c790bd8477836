      "message": "Well, i am always finding it. Another reason, to let the button where it is now: it is always on the same position. Putting it after the name is a bad idea, you have short names:\n\n  Lee\n  Cox\n  Fox \n  Day\n  Way\n  Nix\n\nand long names, just check this thread for authors names there: [1]. So the button would be always on different position. May be put the button before name and not after it? But as i said, i am happy, where it is now.\n\n [1] https://groups.google.com/d/topic/repo-discuss/NuFti4SVNQM/discussion",

My reply should be here instead:\n\n\nI have asked a handful developers here to find the Reply-button (and not the one at the top header).

A few even found the strange position humorous. \n\n\nI can move it to the left side of the name, but I really think it should be moved from the current position. You reply to an author, not a time-stamp.\n\n\nSome more input would be nice though. Perhaps I\u0027m alone wanting to move it.",
