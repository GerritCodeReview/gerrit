Would then the `modules/index-elasticsearch` another candidate?\n\nI believe this contribution is really useful and it would be nice to have the CI running it for incoming changes. However, I am concerned about its maintenance and dependencies.\n\nAlso, I am concerned about its discoverability:\n- If someone is using Docker with Gerrit, then he would definitely be interested in it\n- If someone is using Elasticsearch, then it could be for a multi-primary and then again it would be useful",

I did tried to create a Lucene based multi primary setup and it did not work as expected.\n\nI believe it might be a good idea to move this code to docker-gerrit as it improves the discoverability (as we would document it) and probably solves the dependencies aspect as well.\n\n@martin.fick@linaro.org / @nasser.grainawi@linaro.org WDYT?",
