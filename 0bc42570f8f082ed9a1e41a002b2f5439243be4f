      "message": "\u003e This change also considerably changes the scenario. Can we do that in a separate change or at least mention that here in the commit message?\n\nDone, by patching this change now with a new file instead for that (new) scenario. So the original scenario(s) remain untouched for now. I\u0027m also rebasing this change on the latest version of the framework, which changed fairly since this very change was initiated.\n\nMy patch removes the mention of K8s, unless we clarify what is meant by that instance; where is that cluster exactly?\n\n\u003e In general it would be a good idea to have a document describing the scenarios provided in the project, and how and when to use them.\n\nMaybe propose a new e2e_tests Issue in Monorail [1] for this?\n\n[1] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/list?q\u003dcomponent%3Ae2e_tests",
