      "message": "New features create new failure modes, which is the opposite of what we want on a stable branch. We had a number of urgent security issues recently, and it will be much easier to convince folks to upgrade to a new patchlevel release if they can be sure all of the existing features keep working unchanged.\n\nIf someone needs a new feature on a stable branch, we could either make a separate stable-but-not-so-stable branch, or require it to be on master and encourage the contributor to backport from master in a private fork. \n\nRegardless, I think this is somethnig to decide at ESC level.",
