Some try to fix the issue but don\u0027t really do it properly... and this requires another round of following up from our side etc...\n\nIf rate limits would be enforced, the motivation to fix a misconfigured system would be much higher :-)",

To protect against scripts which perform web based login (instead of the basic auth using the /a prefix) and create an excessive number of web sessions per user eventually causing web sessions of other users to get dropped.\n\n* amount of data transfer. To protect against clients who keep cloning (large) repositories instead of fetching.",
