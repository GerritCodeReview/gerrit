I wouldn\u0027t call a 50% increase from what is likely a large number to start with (since it is typically increasing it from the standard per user limit in the first place) to be \"a bit too high\".  On our servers, this would be 4096.  I\u0027m guessing for some others that would be much higher even.",

      "message": "I understand this. My question is what are the consequences of setting this value too high. I assume there is no consequences. My reasoning is that the previous setting was safe in the sense that Gerrit never uses more file descriptors that 2 times of packedGitOpenFiles if LFS is not used. So, even if we allow Gerrit to open more files, it will not have any impact on anything. It just gives Gerrit a potential possibility to open more files, which is never executed, am I right?\nOTOH not increasing the value is obviously wrong as this will impact installations where LFS is enabled. An alternative approach here would be \nto adjust this setting in a more sophisticated way (based on LFS detection). Do you think it is worth an effort?",
