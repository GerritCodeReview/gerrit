The loop in getInlineComments above already prints out the URL each time the patch key changes, meaning even for a single file, all comments for PS2 are prefixed by a URL with /2/ in it.\n\nIt might also be a little confusing that there is still a \"Patch Set 1\" at the top of the email, but I think that\u0027s still informative as that\u0027s the PS that the top-level message and votes apply to.\n\nIf we do keep this, I think it should be changed to match the UI, with the PS# prefix only if it differs from the top-level.",
