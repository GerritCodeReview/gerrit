Can we instead check to see, if the file //USTOM_PLUGINS (or some such) exists, if yes, include_defs() it and use the content of the variable exposed there, say GERRIT_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_LIST (or something)? We had similar code in gerrit_plugin.bucklet to detect version.",

Would you call manipulating some documentation and Java files as \"cusromization\"? In fact that would mean building and maintaining your own fork. This is a nightmare. OpenStack guys did it once. And it took them years to solve that and come back nearly to the upstream Qulacom guys did it too. They would never ever be able to come even closer to upstream. They will forever remain with 2.4.2.

One of the problems we have with plugins is knowing what revision of the plugins have been built, and what version of Gerrit they were built against.\n\nThe intention here is to add wanted plugins as git submodules, fixed at known revisions, and build them into the released war file together with Gerrit.\n\nTogether with the previous commit, we can fork gerrit at a tagged version (or anywhere else for that matter), apply a couple of patches (set up our internal repo, add plugins, set VERSION) and release a custom war file.",

Why should the community resist someone maintaining a fork of Gerrit? If that\u0027s how they choose to use it, why should we care?
