      "message": "This will unconditionally load all changes from the database which could be an unnecessary performance penalty.\n\nMost of the time we would like to search for changes that are contained in-a-ref of one project.\n\n  inref:stable project:X\n\nWhile a query like\n\n  inref:stable\n\nis possible, it is unlikely that someone will want to search for all changes in ALL projects that are contained in the refs/heads/stable on that project.\n\nI suggest looking at the ChangeQueryRewriter and trying to add an optimization for the (likely) case that the project is also specified. In that case a query which will fetch from the changes table but limited only to that project should be used.",

      "message": "While I agree that for some users it will be unlikely that they will use this without specifying a project, it\u0027s actually our most common use case today. We have a common tag name across 500 or so projects, and using inref:refs/tags/\u003ctag name\u003e lets us find all changes tagged in all of those 500 projects.\n\nWe could still probably use the optimization you suggested, but our query would look like\n\n inref:refs/tags/foo (project:X OR project:Y OR ...)\n\nAnd I\u0027m not sure how easily that will fit into the query rewriter.\n\nI\u0027m fine with offering the optimized version as a follow-on change, but do you really feel it needs to be included in this change?",
