I think it\u0027s a reasonable desire to potentially want a rule that says that only change owners can submit their own changes (or vice versa). I agree the first 4 operators wouldn\u0027t make a lot of sense, but the last 4 are effectively things that can be seen as roles with respect to a change, so it makes sense to me that they would be something that could influence change workflow rules.",
