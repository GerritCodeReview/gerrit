The fact that they live in different instances is an artifact of the implementation, because of the 1-to-1 requirement of VersionedMetaData to refs. (See also Law of Demeter.)\n\nWould it make more sense for this class to just expose the union of all ChangeNotes + DraftCommentNotes methods?\n\nOr, alternatively, maybe we should have a method on ChangeNotes to load drafts for a particular user, and that is responsible for creating \u0026 loading the DraftCommentNotes internally?\n\nThe goal here is to have a consistent interface to display to callers, without them worrying about where data is stored. The end result of each of the two alternatives above would be the same: one class to pass around that lets you get all information you could possibly need about a change.",
