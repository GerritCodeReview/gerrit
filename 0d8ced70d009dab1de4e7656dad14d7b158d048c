Even with one thread I would expect 5K to big too big. I suspect it would need to be at most 1K, and as David O points out, 100 might even be better, particularly if... (see next question),\n\nAre we creating loose objects or packfiles also during the migration? If so, these could slow things down additionally even if we have refs being packed. In my experience having over 300 pack files will make lookups very slow. If each new ref also results in a new pack file, this could be the next slowdown after you repack refs.\n\nIf we are not creating new pack files, but only loose objects, then I suspect we could get away with quite a few loose objects (10K-100K?) without a serious performance impact (I have never identified a specific problematic number for loose objects)? With large migrations, even such a large number might get hit though, and we may need to additionally repack loose objects every now and then also?",

      "message": "Testing with a single repository using a single thread is far away from what we do when migrating a complete production site.\n\nI didn\u0027t test this with a single repository but with copies of our 2 productive sites. One has 300 projects with some very large repositories. \n\nWe used 20 threads only to migrate this site since the very large repositories seem to cause a ton of object allocations on the heap which led to very high gc ratio when using more threads. Using many more threads turned out to be slower than using 20 threads due to the high object allocation rate which drove the java gc crazy.\n\nWe ran the tests on a machine with 176 CPUs and a heap size of 128g. Physical memory available is 1TB split in half for two test instances sharing the same hardware separated using Linux cgroups.\n\nMeanwhile we migrated this site productively and are now running it on 2.16 with notedb. The migration of the production instance was done on a machine with 352 CPUs and a heap size of 256g (physical memory 1TB).

Migration of this single repository takes 11 hours with this complete patch series. The best number of threads seems to be around 20. Using more threads leads to very high gc ratio which slows down the migration.\n\nMigrating all the other 24k projects takes 60-70min with this patch series when we run it using one thread per CPU. We ran these tests on a machine with 176 CPUs and a heap size of 128g. Physical memory 1TB shared between 2 test instances running on the same hardware separated using Linux cgroups. Migration results of repository \"x\" were transferred to this test instance using git fetch. This already migrated repository was skipped when migrating the other 24k projects.\n\nWe neither use SSD nor NFS for storage volumes. Will come back with details soon.",

So I can\u0027t provide scientific prove that this change improves performance by x%. I can try to find time to do this for this individual change but I won\u0027t do it for each of the changes in this series. I already spent several weeks on testing this series and we recently migrated the first of our two productive sites.\n\nWe ran into performance issues after the migration to notedb and found that object allocation rate after the migration to notedb was a lot higher than on reviewdb. Hence java gc ratio went up too much (\u003e50%) causing performance issues. We first throttled the system by reducing thread pool sizes trading less churn in java gc against larger queue sizes. Finally we could mitigate the performance issues to an acceptable level by switching from G1GC to parallel GC and switching off pack.deltaCompression which we could use earlier on 2.16 on reviewdb.\n\nMeanwhile we tried to upgrade a staging copy of this site to 3.2 and found that this fixes the issue of increased object allocation rate. Therefore we are now focussing on preparing the upgrade to 3.2 for the instance which now runs on 2.16 on notedb. Only when this upgrade is done we will migrate the second (larger) site on 2.16 to notedb and immediately all the way up to 3.2 in order to avoid these issues for the second site.",
