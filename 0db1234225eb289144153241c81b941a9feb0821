      "message": "It would not solve the problem because the main mount would still be the bottleneck.\n\nWe are trying to split the load across multiple storages so any solution that requires a main mount having other mounts will suffer the same problems mentioned in this change.\n\nWith this change, the application does \"an if\" to determine if the project goes in another storage and this way, we can really split the load across multiple storages.\n\nMore background about that change:\nWe are getting a lot of reads on some repositories and these numbers are getting bigger, day after day, especially if you add them to the numbers of all the other repositories. I know we could give to heavy repositories a dedicated Gerrit instance but we can\u0027t, we must have all the repositories on the same Gerrit server. We scaled our hardware accordingly but now we see that the bottle neck is the file system and this change is going to allow us to remove that bottle neck by spiting the file system load across multiple volume.\n\nHopefully I can get this change in, otherwise it would mean that we will need to run a fork of Gerrit which we managed to not do so far (we are also up to date with versions, currently running 2.9.4...I know 2.10 is out...). We do have a custom version but only to cherry-pick bug fixes merged in newer version (or master).",
