      "message": "When hovering with the mouse over the expand before and after links the mouse cursor is a text cursor, but for the other links (expand all and line number links) the mouse cursor turns into a hand cursor when hovering. I think for links it should always show the hand cursor, since this cursor normally indicates a clickable link to the user.\n\nI\u0027ve played a bit around with the code and found that\n  Anchor b \u003d new Anchor();\n  b.setHTML(PatchUtil.M.expandBefore(NUM_ROWS_TO_EXPAND));\nshows a text cursor on hovering while\n  Anchor b \u003d new Anchor(PatchUtil.M.expandBefore(NUM_ROWS_TO_EXPAND), true);\nshows a hand cursor on hovering.\n\nI\u0027m not sure why there is this difference in behaviour, but I would suggest to simply go for the second coding to fix this issue.",
