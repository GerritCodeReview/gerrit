Code comment is explaining the code itself.\nIs there any part of the comment that is not relevant to why we are using reInitAndUpdateStops?",

      "message": "oh my bad. somehow I read it as `this fix` :( . I think its just not very clear to me how that relates to the line below. If i read the code without this change as the context, if we need some comment, I would expect it to be something relate to why we need to call `reInitAndUpdateStops` here. And if you really need to refer to this change or some issue, maybe just use either `@see Issue xx` or `@see Change xxx` for more context. Just don\u0027t see why you need to repeat the commit message here.",
