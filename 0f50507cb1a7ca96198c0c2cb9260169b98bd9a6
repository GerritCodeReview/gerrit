      "message": "I think we should be a bit careful with simply using `::part` all over the place. If you need it, then this might also be a sign of bogus component design and a failure of proper encapsulation. For example in this case you could argue that gr-thread-list should be broken down into two components: a header and a body. Then the reply dialog would only re-use the body and it would be easier to style the body component\u0027s padding directly.\n\nI think it is still ok to make the choice and not do that refactoring today and just fix the problem before you go on vacation. But want avoid the impression that using `::part()` is universally a good thing. Most of the time it is not. :-)",
