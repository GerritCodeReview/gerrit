      "message": "The main thing I wanted to avoid with this change is having to write a @Before method for every class that uses SchemaUpgradeTestEnvironment. I am ok with requiring each test class to declare the @Rule field, that\u0027s not too much duplication for me.\n\nThe important thing this is doing is calling injectMembers. Is it possible to have SchemaUpgradeTestEnvironment automatically do this? A TestRule doesn\u0027t have access to the test class, only the Statement and Description, so it doesn\u0027t know what to call injectMembers on.\n\nOne possibility is to pass \"this\" into the SchemaUpgradeTestEnvironment constructor. That feels wrong but I can\u0027t state a concrete reason why. Is it possible that that would cause problems if we combine this with other TestRules and/or Runners?",
