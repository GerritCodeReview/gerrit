      "message": "We have noticed performance regressions in many of the queries we use (mostly larger queries, or queries with plugin operators which do not use the index), and we are trying to restore performance to something that would be acceptable for production use for us (something close to what it was with 2.7). Unfortunately, this likely involves improving some query framework issues with pagination, and we are trying to do this in the least invasive ways (making the configs optional) so that the stable branch risk is reduced.",
