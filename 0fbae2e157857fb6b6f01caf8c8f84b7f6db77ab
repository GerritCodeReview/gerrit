      "message": "I didn\u0027t check any usage numbers, but decided on the order like this:\n\n1. Merge If Necessary first because it\u0027s the default submit action.\n2. Merge Always second because it\u0027s similar to Merge If Necessary and hence should be nearby\n3. Cherry Pick last because using it is discouraged\n4. Fast Forward Only second last because using it is only recommended in rare cases (small project with a low frequency of changes which has special requirements for not breaking the target branch).\n5. Fill in the Rebase actions between Merge Always and Fast Forward Only, in the same order in which the Merge actions are listed, which means Rebase If Necessary first, then Rebase Always.",
