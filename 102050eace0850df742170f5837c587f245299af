Something like that is probably not a responsibility of the rest-api layer, but rather the elements that do an interaction (when you press a button that requires you to be logged in)\n\ngetLoggedIn within this file seems to be used for two purposes:\n- return default preferences, if the account is not logged (like diff preferences) this makes sense\n- save a request to the backend that we know is going to be an error/empty. (requesting parts of the page that are only relevant if you have an account).\n\nThe 2nd is arguably should also be part of the elements calling the rest-api and not rest-api itself, but overall is okay.\n\nIn this particular case, this is not tied to a user action, this rest-api is called, when we render change page, to decide if we should show the \"yellow header\" that says that you have non-empty edit patchset.",
