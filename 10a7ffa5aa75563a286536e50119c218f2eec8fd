Can you explain (and maybe add that as a comment to the code) how are we avoiding having the preview shown twice?\n\n**Few minutes later ðŸ˜Š**: After a more careful look, I\u0027ve noticed, that `this.editing` is the property that makes them mutually exclusive. Which makes sense, one is for the editing and another is for saved object. Can we make this explicit, either by adding a comment, having an extra if condition here or by naming of the functions.",
