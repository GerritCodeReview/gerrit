      "message": "OK to remove this statement, that was missed to remove in this change [1]. Agreed, that Administrators and Batch-Users group are handled differently as other system groups: they are created as real groups in SchemaCreator.initSystemConfig(), where as other system groups are just constants, that defined in SystemGroupBackend class. But why to remove the description of the 2 system groups that handles differently below? Wouldn\u0027t it be enough to mention, that they are handled differently and preserve the description?\n\n\n [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/52433",
