To me, it seems like Guice is more part of the Gerrit server glue, and not really part of a set of low-level-ish tools built on JGit.\n\nWhat classes require Guice here? I noticed TagCache; were there others?\n\n(In terms of keeping the dependency set of this package small, it\u0027s not a big deal.)",
