To me, it seems like Guice is more part of the Gerrit server glue, and not really part of a set of low-level-ish tools built on JGit.\n\nWhat classes require Guice here? I noticed TagCache; were there others?\n\n(In terms of keeping the dependency set of this package small, it\u0027s not a big deal.)",

I would also like if we could avoid this (like it worked for index package), but... even if we would try hard to avoid Guice as direct dependency, like the code is currently organised, we would have transitive dependency on Guice anyway, as many classes depend on GerritServerConfig-Annotation and it depends on com.google.inject.BindingAnnotation.",
