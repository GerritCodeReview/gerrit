      "message": "IIUC is the change implying that Hashtags are sometimes used to store machine-readable metadata and hence should be given fewer characters compared to other fields like repo, topic, branches?\n\nI can see why this works in some cases but in case the repo/topic field is set to 40 characters, then the hashtag field would not take the entire available width.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LVidyLg\n\nIn general I would tend for consistency and let the limit remain as 40.\nWDYT?",

      "message": "My thinking was to optimize for the (presumed) more common case - regularly-sized repo names with a long machine generated hashtag.\n\nEither way I have no strong feelings on this, it just makes instances using Copybara look a little nicer - shame the ellipsis are hard to auto-scale.",
