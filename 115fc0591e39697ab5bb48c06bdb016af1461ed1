      "message": "A single click puts it in the text box allowing you to edit the filter first before adding it (or to not add it at all).  Double clicking is sorta forceful, so I don\u0027t think that it is a bad thing to make it add the watch right away then.  It really is a lot faster if you want to add a bunch than selecting them with checkboxes first, particularly if you want to add a filter here and there.  The checkbox idea seems more appropriate for deletes (slow, thoughtful).  I could add a watch button to the popup, but that seems like overkill since it would then only add the currently selected one which you can already add by clicking on the watch button on the main screen (and this is better because it brings attention to the filter).  Anyway, those are my thoughts, but obviously it was not intuitive to you, so...",

However looking at the popup that appears when pressing \u0027f\u0027 while reviewing files I noticed that there the popup at least closes when you are clicking with the mouse somewhere outside of the popup. I think we should make the same here, so that I\u0027m able to close the popup by clicking with the mouse outside of the popup, if not to introduce \u0027watch\u0027 and \u0027cancel\u0027 buttons as proposed above.",
