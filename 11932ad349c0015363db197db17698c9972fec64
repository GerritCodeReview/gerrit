      "message": "I would like to introduce a somewhat far fetched hypothetical situation in which this proposed committee might come into play to see how this impacts the Gerrit community, I hope you will grant me the artistic license. If you don\u0027t like it, I\u0027ll buy your next round.\n\nLet\u0027s imagine that Google employees wanted to modify Gerrit core to add a single brand new common way to handle CI interactions with Gerrit. Let\u0027s call this hypothetical new feature the \"draughts\" feature. Now in this hypothetical situation, Google engineers, before starting their implementation, present this idea to the community and to their surprise (after all they had some really great ideas) they find that some members of the community object to this new \"draughts\" feature being added in core. Google engineers try to then reason with those members more one on one by setting up a face to face meeting with the community. They explain that developing features in core is easier than putting them in a plugin. They also explain that it would be faster for them and that they have schedules to meet. The community members mention how much better it would be for the community to make the core more flexible by enabling it do to the things they need done via plugins, and that there already are some plugins that do similar things. The overwhelming majority of the community present outside of Google seems to believe that this new \"draughts\" feature does not belong in core, but rather should be implemented as a plugin. After some back and forth, the Google employees believing that some of the other starving community members might be a little hungry, and thus a little grumpy, realize that a consensus is needed and one is reached to implement \"draughts\" as a plugin. Understandably since Google is by far the largest contributor to Gerrit, their management is disappointed about this, and despite the suggestion from their engineers that they could just feed the other community members to get them to change their mind, they decide that they should bring this issue up to the steering committee.\n\nNow at this point, the story diverges in two based on the outcome of the steering committee\u0027s decision (play sound of sliding tube train doors in the background...).\n\nIn variant one (Gwyneth misses the train?), the steering committee, despite having a majority of Google employees on it, decides that the community\u0027s point of view is best for the project and reinforces the view of the Gerrit community members and vetoes putting \"draughts\" in the core of Gerrit. The community is happy and the steering committee is seen as having done the right thing. The Google engineers have to tell their managers that this is what they have to live with since the steering committee made this decision. Google management is upset, but the Google employees on the committee are happy and get to keep having delicious free lunches everyday at work!\n\nIn variant two (Gwyneth catches the train?), the steering committee, since it has a majority of Google employees on it, decides that despite the community\u0027s point of view, it is best for Google if this \"draughts\" feature is merged to core, and they approve of the idea. Google engineers then decide to skip some of their yummy healthy lunches and work real hard to implement this new \"draughts\" feature in time to be top contenders for presenting Gerrit at Google IO this year! So far so good, at least it seems for Google (play Jaws theme). Now some members of the community review the code for the \"draughts\" feature and decide that there really are some issues with the code that won\u0027t work well with the typical infrastructure the community runs Gerrit on and they -2 the \"draughts\" code. Additionally, some of the members of the community realize that if merged in core the \"draughts\" code will likely make it difficult for them to run their current custom CI integration plugin that they have spent years developing. At this point, some of the Google engineers admit that their implementation might not be the best and that the feature as a whole could be problematic, but their managers insist to them \"but we have a deadline, and the steering committee already agreed to this. Please remove those -2s\". (play \"dum dum!\" from Law \u0026 Order)\n\nIf the reader of these scenarios is optimistic, they might now point out that the steering committee is supposed to select variant #1, and that we have to trust them to do so (after all they have always fed us well at the conferences). Of course, since there is no provision in the governance model for replacing steering committee members (ro-sham-bo?), it seems that there is no escape clause if things don\u0027t work out as well as they should (play ominous music). Well, lucky for everyone there is actually an escape clause, a disgruntled community could fork the project and rename their fork to some new obscure furniture maker\u0027s name (although the disgruntled may not want it named after any furniture found in any Google lounges.)\n\nAnother, more prickly reader than most (with his tyrannical power vested from the creator), might point out that the steering committee provided no procedural value in this situation over a variant which didn\u0027t have a steering committee in the first place. Why is that? Because any maintainer could have just -2ed the code at any point. He also points out that this steering committee adds the very bad (however small) risk to the community of variant #2 since it can override vetoes without any real process or community/maintainer\u0027s consensus. This same prickly reader might posit that the creator was trying to avoid this centralization of power through his appointments: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/repo-discuss/maintainer$20martin$20fick|sort:date/repo-discuss/Wn5bogzvSCw/4O2RUDUElmcJ\n\nPhew, that was a bit heavy. Are variants 1 \u0026 2 really the concerns? I don\u0027t know. If not, what then?\n\nThe devil\u0027s advocate reader now steps in and asks \"OK, but what if the community wasn\u0027t really against the \u0027draughts\u0027 feature, and only one maintainer was? That one problematic maintainer is always stopping progress of the project!\" Anyone can likely see how this could be a problem. Of course, some readers might bring it back to trust, and point out that we trust our maintainers to look out for the community, and so did the creator. Another reader might point out that they don\u0027t think this has ever been a problem yet. Finally, however unlikely, a bunch of maintainers admit that this could be a problem (it has after all happened in other projects), and they seek to implement a public community process with a very high bar for removing \"rogue\" maintainers (hint: I heard the prickly reader always chooses \"rock\").\n\nFinally one timid reader asks \"But what recourse will Google management have if they want to introduce features that the community disagrees with?\" Of course, \"the answer is simple\" quips a lone open source bystander sipping his beer: \"the escape clause mentioned above is free for anyone to use. Google employees can look around their lounges for furniture they like and pick a new name for their fork. After all it might be fair to place the onus to study furniture designers on the members who cannot convince all other maintainers that their way is better?\"\n\n\n\nNote 1: in case you wondered why variant #2 has Gwyneth catch the train (I think that\u0027s the one she dies in right?), it\u0027s because of the surprise ending at the end of that variant! It turns out, of course, that most of the disgruntled are too lazy and never bother spying on google lounges.  Instead a super rich obscure Android competitor, with super paranoid management, gives up funding 150 employees to work on Gerrit because they are concerned that the steering committee is fixed to have a majority of Google members on it. Bam! Crazy! Who would have seen that one coming!\n\nNote 2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts\n\nNote 3: After that long boring story Shawn might want us all go sip a beer (but more likely wine) together and write some code to rule the world (or maybe just make jgit more robust). I know I sure would rather do that then write more stories like this. Bottoms Up!",

      "message": "Thanks, Martin for the exciting story, I have the same dilemma every morning when I see a \"sliding doors\" closing in front of me at the Central Line Underground in Ealing Broadway: should I run and take that train? Or wait for the next one? :-)\n\nI do believe and trust that Google\u0027s motivation for having three members of the ESC appointed and not elected *IS NOT* for overruling what the community believes is technically good or bad for the Gerrit architecture.\n\nWe do have examples of \"formally OpenSource projects\" that are not open at all because the plot of the management is to upsell the \"Enterprise Version\" of the OpenSource that costs millions of dollars: Gerrit *IS NOT* that type of project and *SHOULD NEVER* become one of them.\n\nThis is why I would love Google to give assurance and transparency that this is not the purpose and to clarify that they are planning to use as selection criteria. \n\nIf you recall back in 2011 when I first participated to the GitTogether at Mountain View (I was sitting just next to you and Jeff, GitHub was a simple startup of 25 employees, and you had long hair) Gerrit was series of forks all going into different directions: *WE DO NOT WANT* to go back to that point. The plugins infrastructure allowed Gerrit to thrive in many different scenarios and being extended and empowered like never before.\n\nThe reason why Gerrit is so advanced compared to the other similar non-OpenSource or \"not-so-OpenSource\" projects is that we all have put the user\u0027s needs and the common sense in front of the will of corporations, resisting to pressures (I know Shawn had to bear that part).\n\nIn Shawn\u0027s memory and legacy, we should continue on that path.",
