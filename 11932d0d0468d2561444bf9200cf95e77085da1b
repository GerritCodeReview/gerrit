We add tests that run the off-line reindex with consistent and non-consistent writes\n\u003e 5. We implement the non-consistent API in Lucene using some lower-level high-performance primitives\n\nGerrit\u0027s Lucene behavior is currently non-consistent and no changes are required for that. Changes are required if we want to ensure that Gerrit APIs guarantee reads contain data for any completed writes. To be very clear on what this looks like, it\u0027s a simple sequence like this:\n\n # start with change 1234 which has no Code-Review votes\n POST /changes/1234/revisions/1/review # set Code-Review+2 on change 1234\n GET /changes/?q\u003dchange:1234+label:Code-Review\u003d2 # returns change 1234\n\nWith the current Lucene implementation, it\u0027s not guaranteed that the GET returns 1234. With the current ES implementation, it is guaranteed (because refresh\u003dtrue).\n\n\u003e \n\u003e With the above, I agree with Nasser that it makes sense in core and would provide benefit to Gerrit regardless of ES.\n\nI\u0027m not clear on what\u0027s different in your proposal vs this change.
