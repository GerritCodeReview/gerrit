It should under no circumstances call repoManager.openMetadataRepository() if notedb is disabled. That is an illegal state, so throwing IllegalStateException in that case (i.e. the current behavior) is correct.\n\nAm I describing the right bug here?",

BUT I guess this is not what DaveB intended to do.\n\nWhen notesMigration is not enabled, I guess that noteDbPath needs to be null as there is no metaData repository for notesDB correct?\nWhen notesMigration is disabled the openMetdataRepository call *has* to fail because there shouldn\u0027t be any nodesDb activity.\n\nUnfortunately this is not the case as we had the assertion failing. I fear that by returning a valid Git repository (the main one) as valid metdata repository for noteDb ... and possibly more problems on the way :-(\n\nWorth waiting for Shawn and DaveB feedback on this point.",
