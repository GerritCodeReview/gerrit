      "message": "So I added read permissions to \"refs/draft-comments\" and \"refs/starred-changes\" to anonymous users by default, on All-Projects initialization.\n\nI then re-treated and preferred to allow implicit visibility in code to these refs. That won\u0027t hurt anyway because we are only allow users to access their own refs (example: user cannot view drafts of another user). This is needed for now so that we preserve the current behaviour for refs visibility, but in a later change, we can remove visibility to these refs because they are not needed.",
