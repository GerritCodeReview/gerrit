JGit ist its own cell, andt it cannot references rules outside, That\u0027s because this would resolve  (in tree) to:\n\n  lib/jgit/lib:json\n\nSo the file lib/jgit/lib/BUCK exists, to make license machiners work, but there is no gson library there. So may be it can be dropped and added always where jgit-lfs-server itself used.",
