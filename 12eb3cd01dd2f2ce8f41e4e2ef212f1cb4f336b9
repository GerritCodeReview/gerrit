      "message": "I don\u0027t know that git diff/jgit diff output gets localized. Does it?\n\nAlso, would you prefer I make all of the strings in this function constants? I was following the pattern already established in this file, but upon further research it looks like this same discussion was had at that time too.\n\nhttps://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/103011",
