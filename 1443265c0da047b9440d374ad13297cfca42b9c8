      "message": "We currently don\u0027t have this dependency inside Google. For testing only, we could add it. The problem is that our Apache SSH lib is at 2.1 and JGit is using 2.4 which is incompatible as well.\n\nIt will require effort to get Apache SSH updated to 2.4 and make JGit test dependencies for our Gerrit to have a test dependency on.\n\nI would prefer if we didn\u0027t have to do this and I believe that path will also be faster to execute on:\nIf you separate the JSch/Mina logic into two classes that have the same interface and then call either one with reflection or Guice bindings, we can just skip importing the Mina file and nothing will break as no existing class would grow a dependency on mina.",
