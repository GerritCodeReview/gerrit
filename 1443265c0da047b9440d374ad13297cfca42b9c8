We\u0027re internally still sticking to the non-default /old \u0027MINA\u0027 for reliability purposes so far. Maybe that \u0027NIO2\u0027 default will become confusing for some, while comparing it to its \u0027MINA\u0027 counterpart and this change\u0027s own \u0027MINA\u0027 option to eventually become default (over JSCH).\n\n[3] https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.1.0/config-gerrit.html#sshd.backend\n\nThat eventuality will lend 3 possible values for ssh-related configuration parameters, along with differing defaults. These are differing parameters indeed, but they will use terms and defaults differing in potentially confusing ways for users, whole ssh-wise.\n\nI\u0027d either clarify the documentation accordingly, or revisit how to name the configuration values (and their defaults). Of course, names and defaults can hardly change in stable revisions. This would then be done for breaking or not so stable versions.\"",

      "message": "We currently don\u0027t have this dependency inside Google. For testing only, we could add it. The problem is that our Apache SSH lib is at 2.1 and JGit is using 2.4 which is incompatible as well.\n\nIt will require effort to get Apache SSH updated to 2.4 and make JGit test dependencies for our Gerrit to have a test dependency on.\n\nI would prefer if we didn\u0027t have to do this and I believe that path will also be faster to execute on:\nIf you separate the JSch/Mina logic into two classes that have the same interface and then call either one with reflection or Guice bindings, we can just skip importing the Mina file and nothing will break as no existing class would grow a dependency on mina.",
