      "message": "My issue with the staleness is it doesn\u0027t tell you it won\u0027t merge until you open it. After its been opened by someone then it will start to tell you its stale. If the conflict magically goes away, its going to lie and say it has a conflict until its opened again and recomputed.\n\nI\u0027d like this to be somehow more consistent if we are going to show it on the search results and dashboard pages.",
