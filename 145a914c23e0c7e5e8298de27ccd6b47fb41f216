      "message": "About both, gr-account-display-name-behavior.html and gr-group-display-name-behavior.html:\n\nThe three utilities AccountDisplayNameBehavior, AnonymousNameBehavior, GroupDisplayNameBehavior are very small. Maybe we can have just one AccountBehavior that encapsulates everything related to accounts and could potentially be used in a lot of components? Generally I like the idea of moving such code into domain oriented utilities.\n\nAlso, GroupDisplayNameBehavior is extremely small. Even though I enjoy the symmetry in gr-reviewer-suggestions-provider.js very much (great code style!), the mapping \"(group) \u003d\u003e group.name + \u0027 (group)\u0027\" is so simple that it should either go into a bigger group related utility class (if you think the method is useful elsewhere) or could just be inlined in gr-reviewer-suggestions-provider.js.",

The lines between html and js are blurred. You could still put ...provider\u003d\"new ReviewerProvider(restapi)\"... or something similar into the template and be fairly declarative.\n\nAlso the current way of slotting and looking up what is in the slot seems a bit hacky.
