      "message": "About both, gr-account-display-name-behavior.html and gr-group-display-name-behavior.html:\n\nThe three utilities AccountDisplayNameBehavior, AnonymousNameBehavior, GroupDisplayNameBehavior are very small. Maybe we can have just one AccountBehavior that encapsulates everything related to accounts and could potentially be used in a lot of components? Generally I like the idea of moving such code into domain oriented utilities.\n\nAlso, GroupDisplayNameBehavior is extremely small. Even though I enjoy the symmetry in gr-reviewer-suggestions-provider.js very much (great code style!), the mapping \"(group) \u003d\u003e group.name + \u0027 (group)\u0027\" is so simple that it should either go into a bigger group related utility class (if you think the method is useful elsewhere) or could just be inlined in gr-reviewer-suggestions-provider.js.",

      "message": "gr-account-entry seems unnecessarily complex, because it requires three input properties (filter, querySuggestions, makeSuggestionItem) and translates them here into _autocompleteQuery. What about just moving this code into gr-account-list? Would it make the components simpler maybe?\n\nSide note: The term \"query\" relates to something with \"string\" type IMO. I know this is just existing code, but I would prefer even something ugly as inputToSuggestionFunction. You have chosen querySuggestionsCallback, which is also pretty good.",
