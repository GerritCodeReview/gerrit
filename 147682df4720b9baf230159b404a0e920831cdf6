      "message": "I agree it\u0027s simple, but it\u0027s also depending on a lot of what I would consider an implementation detail. What if the annotate process errors out somehow? What if a future version wants to annotate in a different order or in parallel? \n\nI would personally prefer to make one pass over coverageRanges as they come in and write them into a Map by number. That is probably efficient enough (it\u0027s still amortized linear) and makes less assumptions / will require less comments to explain this slightly odd requirements and approach...\n\nIt might also allow you to only have a single coverage layer for both sides?",

      "message": "I agree that there are various approaches to solving this, and maybe the proposed algorithm is not the ultimate solution. However, it is still simple, implemented and tested. And I cannot see serious concerns: Can you be more specific about what the assumptions that are made that might break? Why is a single layer better?\n\nI had considered the map approach. I think I was worried about the maps getting quite large and the memory consumption associated with that. If you have a COVERED range from line 100-199, then would you create 100 map entries for that? Even if the answer is yes, I guess we could afford the memory (with no map entry meaning NOT INSTRUMENTED). OTOH it will be slightly less robust against huge file issues.\n\nAnyway, I don\u0027t have the one hour that it takes to rewrite this at the moment. :-( Feel free to jump in and write a follow-up change.",
