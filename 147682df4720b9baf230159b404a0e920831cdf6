      "message": "I agree it\u0027s simple, but it\u0027s also depending on a lot of what I would consider an implementation detail. What if the annotate process errors out somehow? What if a future version wants to annotate in a different order or in parallel? \n\nI would personally prefer to make one pass over coverageRanges as they come in and write them into a Map by number. That is probably efficient enough (it\u0027s still amortized linear) and makes less assumptions / will require less comments to explain this slightly odd requirements and approach...\n\nIt might also allow you to only have a single coverage layer for both sides?",
