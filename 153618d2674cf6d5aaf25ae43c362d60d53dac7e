      "message": "I intentionally removed this line in Ib2ef8dff94 but given the combination of BUCK and run-server.sh this was a mistake. I was confused by this statement in the commit message:\n\n  Delete $SRCDIR/bower_components before linking since folder \n  gets created by \u0027run-server.sh\u0027.\n\nin Ibccbbcb752f2. Because run-server.sh created the directory in polygerrit-ui/app, and Buck is using another directory:\n\n  gerrit/buck-out/gen/polygerrit-ui/app/gr-app__vulcanized__srcs\n\nBut this tree is created from already manipulated (by run-server.sh) polygerrit-ui/app directory. That why we have real directory there and not just symbolic link.\n\nTo reproduce you always need to run Buck fist, run run-server.sh, re-run Buck: now it\u0027s broken.\n\nActually creating non-versioned stuff in your source tree is always a bad idea and confuse your build toolchain, but this is a topic for another change.",
