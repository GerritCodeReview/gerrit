      "message": "I\u0027m glad you caught this.\n\nAs it happens, the mapping of PLUS to SPACE is something that I wasn\u0027t fully intending, and actually didn\u0027t intend to introduce into a test. It snuck into the test case as a side effect of using Chrome\u0027s URL bar to percent-encode my test data. And the decoding came as a side effect of using the java.net URL decoder.\n\nHowever, I think sticking with the PLUS-TO-SPACE conversion probably makes sense, since it sticks closer to the URL standard.  I\u0027ll make it explicit.",

Catching Exception is usually a smell, but I see why you did it.\n\nI think a slightly safer thing would be:\n\n* wrap UnsupportedEncodingException in an IllegalStateException and rethrow (since UTF-8 not being found is a thing that Should Not Happen)\n* catch and ignore IllegalArgumentException\n\nThe only downside is URLDecoder\u0027s Javadoc does not explicitly say that IAE is the only thing that will be thrown on invalid input (although I just checked the implementation and it is).",
