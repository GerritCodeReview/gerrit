Catching Exception is usually a smell, but I see why you did it.\n\nI think a slightly safer thing would be:\n\n* wrap UnsupportedEncodingException in an IllegalStateException and rethrow (since UTF-8 not being found is a thing that Should Not Happen)\n* catch and ignore IllegalArgumentException\n\nThe only downside is URLDecoder\u0027s Javadoc does not explicitly say that IAE is the only thing that will be thrown on invalid input (although I just checked the implementation and it is).",
