      "message": "I see. It is problematic though. Because plugins like the \"Reviewers Plugin\" keeps re-adding users and those users keeps getting notified on changes they have chosen to actively Ignore.\n\nI think Assignee is OK to get a notification from, since it is a more direct request for Action.\n\nBut I think it is a common scenario to Ignore a change and then remove yourself as reviewer. If you do get added anyway (especially automatically) you really do not want a mail about it. To ignore a change, you most certainly have been a reviewer at one point and decided that you do not want to be involved in that change.",

      "message": "Maybe the \"Reviewers Plugin\" should just not add users as reviewers that have ignored the change?\n\nThe use-case that currently works well is this:\n1) you watch all changes of a project\n2) there is a change with many updates that don\u0027t interest you, hence you ignore it\n3) somewhen later somebody thinks that you should comment on this change and adds you as reviewer\n4) you get an email now, as somebody explicitly wants your review on the change and you get a chance to accept this review request",
