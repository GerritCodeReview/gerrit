That\u0027s because\n\n* @jgit//:jgit and \n* @jgit//:junit\n\nin JGit Buck driven build were implemented as java_library with exported_deps only, and as such, they don\u0027t have output file associated with them, so that $(location :foo) macro used in javadoc api rule can\u0027t work and is failing as expected with this scary error message: [1].\n\nThere are three trivial work arounds, though:\n\n* A. Drop javadocs from the API dependencies in Gerrit: [2]\n* B. Apply this patch: [3] to JGit to use prebuilt_jar() instead of java_library() that only references exported dependencies\n* C. Use export_file() instead of prebuilt_jar() in B. The patch for this option is left as an exercise for the reader\n\nEither way `buck build api` should just work with hijacked JGit cell. Thanks to Sasa for reporting this issue.\n\n* [1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/486878\n* [2] http://paste.openstack.org/show/486880\n* [3] http://paste.openstack.org/show/486876",
