      "message": "In data analysis you may want to group by event name. Then it would probably be better to give this a fixed name like \"long-js-task\". The task name is rather a detail.\n\nOTOH I understand that you want to only have the duration in the value field, that also makes it easier to do data analysis. So a third option might be to not report the task.name at all. Is it meaningful?\n\nAnyway, feel also free to ignore my comment and keep as is.",
