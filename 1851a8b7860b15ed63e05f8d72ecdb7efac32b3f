IncorrectObjectTypeException here means HEAD is a non-symbolic ref that points to a valid non-commit object; if you remove this case, then *nobody* can read it via this endpoint.\n\nI believe the reason it is this way is that Gerrit doesn\u0027t support permissions on HEAD itself, so checking for a project owner is the next best thing.\n\nI would be ok with any of the following:\n\n* Check SET_HEAD\n* Check WRITE_CONFIG (i.e. preserve old behavior)\n* Add a new permission READ_HEAD (although this feels like overkill)",
