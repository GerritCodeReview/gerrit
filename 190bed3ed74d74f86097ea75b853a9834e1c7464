      "message": "the autotest failure could be easily fixed (with the interesting side effect that assertNotifyCc() could be removed entirely), but i\u0027m actually not sure about the whole thing.\n\nthe original issue as i filed it suggests that there was no cc field, either, so the actual problem was probably the use of bcc instead of to/cc, and i ended up in reply-to only due to a bug (see acf084069a2).\n\nif so, i\u0027m not quite sure what to do about it - we could promote the Bcc to To, but that isn\u0027t acceptable if the message has multiple bccs, as they are not supposed to see each other.\n\ni suppose one could add a fake To containing the sender.\n\nbut there is a wider issue that bccs are generally a bit of spam filter trigger, so the real fix would be atomizing the bcc list and sending everyone their own mail with To. this would be a bit tougher on gerrit\u0027s smtp workers and the relaying mta\u0027s incoming queue.",
