      "message": "You\u0027re mixing two things together here:\n\n* manually injecting dependencies needed to perform the operation\n* deciding details of behavior that the caller wants performed\n\nIt feels weird to be toggling behavior by injecting/not injecting dependencies.\n\nThe Guicier way to do this is to use assisted injection. Then there is a clear separation between arguments that are injected dependencies (implicit injected args) and arguments that control the behavior (assisted injected args, i.e. args to the factory create method). For a simple example of using assisted injection to create a BatchUpdateOp, see SetAssigneeOp",
