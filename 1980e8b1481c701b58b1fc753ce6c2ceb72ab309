      "message": "Maybe we should just limit it to refs/heads/ instead?  refs/heads/ is the branch namespace.  You really shouldn\u0027t be uploading a commit for review onto a non-branch.\n\nWe also could fix this via permissions.  Change READ to actually be:\n\n  READ +1..+1 refs/*\n  READ +1..+2 refs/heads/*\n\nand that leaves room for the site administrator to change the behavior and permit uploads on a non-refs/heads/ name if they so choose, simply by granting READ +2 on the proper name.\n\nBut right now we are hardcoded to require READ to be on refs/* only.  We\u0027d have to relax this restriction when adding an access control.  And change the defaults.\n\nThoughts?",
