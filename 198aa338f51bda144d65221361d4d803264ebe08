      "message": "The commit message is meant to be mostly self-contained when you have gerrit\u0027s git history. Can that discussion be summarized here?\n\nE.g. something like this:\n\nDo not include cookbook plugin in release.war\n\n1164e53283187b8a2a79052f5ea85471f6f0b6d4 (Allow to add custom core\nplugins in release build, 2015-12-11) added an item CUSTOM to the buck\nplugin rules to make it easier for people to add additional \u0027core\u0027\nplugins in a release build of a forked copy of Gerrit.\n\nWhen that was ported to bazel, it included cookbook-plugin by mistake.\nAs a result, when someone runs\n\n  bazel build release\n\nthey get a copy of gerrit with the cookbook plugin included and\nenabled, which is almost never what they wanted.\n\nFix it by making the default list of custom plugins an empty list\nagain.",
