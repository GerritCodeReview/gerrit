(Not trying to presume one way or the other about your previous git experience.)\n\nTwo, I tend to use number of files changed as a rough estimate for how long it\u0027s going to take me to review something, and too many files can make my eyes glaze over.

It\u0027s not that you want to do that per se, it\u0027s that it\u0027s the easiest way to swap LHS and RHS without having to switch one of them to a temporary unrelated patch set.\n\nI\u0027m thinking we can fix this directly by saying, if you click a patch set number that would lead to N..N, instead just swap them.\n\nI\u0027m fine with bailing and redirecting somewhere else if you encounter N..N in a URL.",
