I think we could learn from Buck team at FB, and require \"Test Plan: foo bar\" section (extend to dev-contributing) in such cases to be added in the commit message.\n\nFor this specific change this section could be (i think):\n\nTest Plan:\n\n* compile a GWT enabled plugin (cookbook plugin or serviceuser plugin)\n* deploy the GWT plugin to $gerrit_site/plugins\n* start Gerrit\n* check that full screen exposed by plugin is still working",
