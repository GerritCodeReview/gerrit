      "message": "It definitely feels hacky to put this here as it breaks the component boundary. I assume you put it here (as opposed to gr-syntax-layer.html) so that it would not be vulcanized. Is there no way to cause vulcanize to ignore a script tag, or maybe compute the prefix in the component based on how vulcanize changed a similar path?",
