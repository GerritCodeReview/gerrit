      "message": "It seems, the method itself has some problems and it works only with _legacyUndefinedCheck: true or in Polymer 1.\n\nThe method is used here (in gr-access-section.html):\n[[_computePermissions(section.id, capabilities, labels, section.value.permissions.*)]]\n\nIf I am not mistaken, in legacy mode this method is called only when all properties are assigned (section, capabilities, labels). But with Polymer 2 it can be called multiple times.\n\nAlso, the return value of this method depends on the this.section value. This value is also loaded asynchronous, so _computePermissions should be called after this.section has been updated.",
