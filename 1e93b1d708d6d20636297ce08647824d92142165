      "message": "\u003e Can we avoid getting into this error-state at all?\nIn the ideal world we would not get any errors from the server and we don\u0027t need this change at all. 😄\n\nWhat do you think should be the behaviour if server does throw an error? We might get an error for other reasons as well.\n\nThe reason I prefer not showing an error popup is because I feel it would be too disruptive and I don\u0027t want in those cases where we get an error to disrupt the overall flow of the user.\n\nIn case you feel it is better to throw an error then I don\u0027t mind keeping the existing behaviour although I would say this would lead to a much poorer user experience\nMuch better would be the proposed one where we track those errors using reporting and the user can still create a comment without seeing a popup.",
