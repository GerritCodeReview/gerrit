      "message": "writeMergeCommit() is called only by mergeOneCommit(), which in turn is called by strategy/CherryPick.java:CherryPickMultipleParentsOp, strategy/RebaseSubmitStrategy.java:RebaseMultipleParentsOp, and strategy/MergeOneOp.java in their code for handling the submission of a change which itself is a merge commit. So I think this code is less about the merge commit automatically created by one of the Merge strategies, and more about someone trying to land a merge commit using one of the other strategies. If someone has uploaded a merge commit for review, but the submit strategy is \"Rebase Always\", I\u0027d expect that merge commit to have its Author Timestamp overwritten when it gets submitted.",
