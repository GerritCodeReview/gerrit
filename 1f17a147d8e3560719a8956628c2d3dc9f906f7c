Right now, only changes created using the cherry-pick functionality populate that data. There could be other sources that populate that data(like manual cherry-picks), but, it would be a feature in itself.\n\nIf you have any good ideas on how one would be able to improve the data set by supporting manual cherry-picks, it would certainly be a good addition to this functionality.",

There are many ways that a human can make this not be the case. In the early days of Gerrit, some people reused change-id across projects to show that changes were related. I believe Shawn wanted to even make it a \"submit together\" policy. I specifically advocated against it for the exact reason that it was unnatural since the change-id is naturally there during a cherry-pick. \n\nThe other more serious problem with this, is that it does not convey direction, i.e. which change was cherry-picked from which one, and might there have been other cherry-picks in the middle, or perhaps both have a common commit they were both cherry-picked from?",
