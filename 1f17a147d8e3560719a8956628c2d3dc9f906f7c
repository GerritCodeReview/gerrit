      "message": "Yes, they will be missed.\n\nIn the previous change where cherrypickof was introduced, we created a data set which contains the source \u0027change number\u0027 and \u0027patchset\u0027. Right now, only changes created using the cherry-pick functionality populate that data. There could be other sources that populate that data(like manual cherry-picks), but, it would be a feature in itself.\n\nIf you have any good ideas on how one would be able to improve the data set by supporting manual cherry-picks, it would certainly be a good addition to this functionality.",
