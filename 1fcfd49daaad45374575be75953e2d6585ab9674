This doesn\u0027t seem to work as expected: Bazel build is still failing from IJ 2016.2.\n\nFWIW: the result is the same, as if the bagel build gerrit would be started from the command line with eclipse-out tree in place.\n\nIn Buck there is option to exclude some directories from the build in .buckconfig:\n\n  project.ignore \u003d .git, eclipse-out, bazel-gerrit, bin\n\nSee also my comment on: [1].\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/89952",
