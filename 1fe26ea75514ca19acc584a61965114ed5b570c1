I don\u0027t want BAM to be out of sync with View and I prefer the deviation from what we fetched to be more local and explicit than modifying ChangeInfos would be. Also I don\u0027t want to do a wider-scoped soft-reload that preserves some state (dialog open) because I think it will be bug-prone.",
