RebaseChange needs to be injected into SubmitStrategyFactory to do the rebase when the \u0027Rebase If Necessary\u0027 strategy is selected. The whole merge algorithm is done in a background job in a context where no current user is available and hence the injection of the user failsÂ´here. As result merging the change fails and it gets stuck in \u0027Submitted, Merge Pending\u0027 state.",
