If i understand your follow-up change correctly, you are only trying to optimize development environment/build tool chain.\nIf so please just say it this way. If no, and you are really trying to create gerrit_doc_without_search.war then you still don\u0027t provide the root level Buck rule for this:\n\n  $ buck build gerrit\n  $ buck build gerrit_doc_without_search\n\nSo either the commit message is misleading or your change isn\u0027t complete.",
