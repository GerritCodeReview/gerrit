      "message": "Bazel is build tool system from Google, extacted from internal used Blaze tool chain. Bazel build files are written in Skylark, that is a subset of Python. Google\u0027s style guide for Python is: [1] 4 spaces indent, while the java styleguide is 2 spaces indent: [2]. That\u0027s unfortunate, but that is the state of the matters. Obviously, buildifier tool doesn\u0027t provide any means to change the indentation and uses hard coded 4 spaces to enforce the same style to all build files across all projects.\n\nHaving said that, similar questions was already raised on the Bazel issue traceker, see for example: [3].\n\n@Damien, do you have any comments on this?\n\n* [1] https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Indentation\n* [2] https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.2-block-indentation\n* [3] https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/63",
