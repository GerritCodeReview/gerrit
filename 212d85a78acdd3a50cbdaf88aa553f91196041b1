      "message": "I am not sure, that this is align with the idea of node modules resolution.\n\nAs I can see, right now polymer-bridges are copied to node_modules during the build. This is not good, because we can get version conflicts if we add dependencies to polymer-bridges. Having polymer-bridges as a package in package.json we can be sure, that yarn will resolve version conflicts correctly and the node_modules directory layout is valid.\n\nAlso, I suppose, that IntelliJ (and other IDEs) can\u0027t find this polymer-bridges, so they will not work properly.",
