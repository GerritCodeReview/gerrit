You are correct here (we\u0027ve done it with codemirror-minified as you\u0027ve seen).\n\nAlthough i think we should still do it in app/package.json rather then plugins package.json (since i think that one is intended to be replaced with what ever plugin requires the use of that plugin that is non core).\n\nI\u0027d like to help you progress this along as i got it working for me locally.",
