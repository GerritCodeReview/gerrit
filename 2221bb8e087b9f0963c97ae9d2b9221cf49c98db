If we still need this support in master, then it should be written differently. You can create a product excellence issue for our fixit next week, if you would rather like the frontend team fixing the issue in master.\n\nCan we maybe stop supporting server-side generated Change-Ids in 3.7? What are the plans?\n\nEven if we stop supporting server-side generated Change-Ids, then do we still need to show them for browsing historical changes?",
