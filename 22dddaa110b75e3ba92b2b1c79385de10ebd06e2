As documented at [1], `Array#sort` is not necessarily stable, and browsers implementations have the option to take shortcuts (with the assumption that they\u0027ve been given a good comparator). My suspicion is that Safari just has a non-stable sort in a different way than Chrome does, and the difference exposed that the comparator was wrong.\n\n* [1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort",
