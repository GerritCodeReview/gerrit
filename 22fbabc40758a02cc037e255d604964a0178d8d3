      "message": "Unless I\u0027ve screwed something up, the only way this ReviewDb can be a DisabledChangesReviewDbWrapper is if you explicitly set notedb.readChanges \u003d true in gerrit.config.\n\nThis is not a supported configuration. We do *not* need to handle the case during schema migrations where notedb reading was turned on prior to the latest schema. You\u0027re pretty much on your own here. I would recommend turning notedb off before proceeding.\n\nLong term, we should probably hook into RebuildNoteDb to run any outstanding ReviewDb schema upgrades before rebuilding, at which point we may revisit this discussion. But for now, you have to be doing something unsupported in order to get in this state.",
