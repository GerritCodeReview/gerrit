With regards to the stats transition allowed or not, it is up to us to decide.\n\nA flag just doesn\u0027t make sense to me. E.g. Abandoned change in WIP state? Is it WIP (someone is working on it) or abandoned (nobody is working on it)? Just confusing IMHO.\n\nWIP is a state as the name suggest (Work-in-progress). If we want just to introduce yet another flag, let\u0027s renamed it to something else more meaningful, but not WIP please otherwise is getting very confusing.",
