With regards to the stats transition allowed or not, it is up to us to decide.\n\nA flag just doesn\u0027t make sense to me. E.g. Abandoned change in WIP state? Is it WIP (someone is working on it) or abandoned (nobody is working on it)? Just confusing IMHO.\n\nWIP is a state as the name suggest (Work-in-progress). If we want just to introduce yet another flag, let\u0027s renamed it to something else more meaningful, but not WIP please otherwise is getting very confusing.",

      "message": "@Luca, You made a valid point. The original implementation of David Shrewsbury WIP feature was in fact based on Change.Status field: [1]. The wip plugin also uses (or better to say abuses DRAFT value for marking a change as WIP). \n\nBesides, that it seems to be a never ending story, there is one advantage to make it an attribute of a change instead of extend Status enum with yet another value, that is not a boolean, but a timestamp, or both. That way you can classify the patch set upload after that timesatmp as being wip patch set, *without* messing around with wip bit on a patch set.\n\nAnother argument for an attribute: is extensibility. That was Martin\u0027s point to let Change.Status enum alone, as you cannot really extend a enum from the plugin in Java. The idea is to support generic worklfow, and all what you need is to add an attribute to a change, that seems to be feasable to achieve from a plugin with NoteDb in mind and extend secondary index, and git push option.\n\nBut anyway, let us drive this discussion not here, in implementation change, but in proposal change:[2]. BTW, in early patch sets of that proposal change, it was discussed, to have a dedicated wip status value in Change.Status, but the reviewers preferred attribute rather then a status.\n\nI personally not going to drive this discussion again. I see it from the user prespective, all she wants is to mark a change as wip. How it is achived, whether per status or attribute doesn\u0027t really matter.\n\nOpen source project is not a debate club. At the end someone has to make a decision. For me, thet dicision was made in context of: [2]. But feel free to re-open that discussion again, the: [2] and this change was not merged yet.\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/36091\n* [2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/97245",
