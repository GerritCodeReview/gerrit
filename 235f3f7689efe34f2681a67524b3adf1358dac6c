      "message": "Any specific reason you changed this from map to a plain array? If it was just the indexes that you needed, note that you can get them as second parameter: \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map#Syntax\n\nThis is a bit of a matter of taste, but for straight forward 1:1 mappings, I tend to like map a lot because it expresses this 1:1 mapping idea well. A for loop can be anything really, and I find I have to read the code more closely to see \"ahh, this is a 1:1 mapping.\n\nChanging this back is optional, but I wanted to share my opinion.",
