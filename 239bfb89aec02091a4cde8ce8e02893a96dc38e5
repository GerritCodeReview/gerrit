But how quickly such a message shows up depends on what the merge queue scan frequency is. Oftentimes people will complain before waiting long enough for a message to appear. (And, sadly, the reason they think complaining is the right thing to do is that Gerrit has acquired a reputation for being unreliable when it comes to merging changes.)",
