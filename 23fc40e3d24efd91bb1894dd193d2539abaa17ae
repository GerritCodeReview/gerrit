      "message": "I agree with Tao. Nearly all the Behaviors are actually utility functions, and I would also prefer to call utility functions instead of mixing in methods. I have run into the issue multiple times where I was wondering where a method was defined, and then I found it in some Behavior.\n\nBut I would also understand, if you want to focus your current changes on removing the globals. We can do the behavior -\u003e util conversion at a later point in time.",
