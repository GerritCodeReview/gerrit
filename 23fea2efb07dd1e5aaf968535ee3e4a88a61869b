      "message": "Even after reading this code, it\u0027s not completely clear to me what this has to do with \"order\". Where is the \"check if it\u0027s the last diff\"? Does this just happen for every diff, only after it is completely rendered including syntax highlighting and all. Is this really guaranteed to be after all diffs have finished rendering, or is it just a little later so makes the situation usually better?\n\nI guess I have to admit I still have not fully understood the behavior we want: When all diffs are done rendering, we turn the auto scrolling back on - but does that mean we do auto-scroll in the very end, or we don\u0027t because setting it back to auto-scroll happens after we are completely done rendering and after the render-content event was handled in gr-diff-cursor?",
