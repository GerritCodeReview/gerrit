To offer this we would need complete container that include 100% options: AuthInfo. With this in place it would be trivially to fill only subset of this options for GET /config/server/info endpoint. Now, when other consumers of the REST API would need more options they would call GET /config/server/auth and would get 100% auth section from gerrit.config.",

I would rather only expose what is\nreally needed. Once exposed it becomes API and we cannot easily change\nit anymore. There might be also some configuration parameters which\nare security relevant and which must not be exposed.\nWe also don\u0027t want to blindly return the values that are in\ngerrit.config, but we might want to return computed values (e.g.\nreturn the default value if there is nothing in gerrit.config) or\nreturn a different format. Some things might even not be contained in\ngerrit.config, but depend on the installed plugins (e.g. download\ncommands).\nIf the full raw gerrit.config is needed you can already install the\nserver-config plugin [1] and get it from there.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-plugins.html#server-config",
