You could have a\n    \n    Depends-On: $CHANGE_ID\n\nbut think about how the work flow would look like for a while. You\u0027d create the commit in the first repo. How much knowledge do you expect the standard user to have about the change IDs? So they commit and look at the commit to retrieve the change ID and copy paste that into the commit of the second repo. \nBetter to be safe, they also copy the change ID of the commit from the second repo to the commit of the first repo.\n\nThat would work, but is that a viable and easy way we should impose on the user? I think we can do better.\n\nSo how about this:\nIn all repositories we want to make changes which depend on each other in a way, we put\n\n    Depends-On: \"My random topic affecting different repos\"\n\nThat string can be anything, it must be unique for all the\ncurrently open changes.

We did not discuss the CI dependency issue you bring up, so I\u0027ll leave to Stefan to respond to that.\n\nThe idea was to not introduce an N+1th way of grouping changes together, and instead reuse the existing topic feature for this purpose. If a change has a topic, provide a way at submit time (e.g. a checkbox) to also submit all other changes in that topic. Leave it unchecked by default to preserve the current behavior.\n\nAdvantages include:\n\n* Actually give some functionality to topic other than \"like a hashtag but there can be only one of them\".\n* Reuse existing \"Same topic\" tab on change screen rather than adding an N+1th tab.\n* Allow submitting multiple changes in sequence on a single repo by clicking \"Submit\" only on the last one, which as you know has been a feature request for years.",
