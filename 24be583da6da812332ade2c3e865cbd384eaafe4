      "message": "I am a bit unhappy with this being moved into API like that, because I find this really needs to be cleaned up. There are so many places where PARENT does not make sense at all. And others where \u0027edit\u0027 does not make sense. So I was thinking that we could maybe move towards types where `PatchSetNum` is always a number. And then you would allow `PatchSetNum | \u0027PARENT\u0027` on a case by case basis.\n\nThat said, we should probably be able to clean up API users in the near future without too much work.",
