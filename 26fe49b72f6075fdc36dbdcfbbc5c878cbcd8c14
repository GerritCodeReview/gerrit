      "message": "This has an unfortunate side effect of caching a null UUID inside the GroupList. This is then exposed as a null entry from the getAllGroupUUIDs() method below, which callers may not be expecting (we have a custom GroupBackend which choked on this).\n\nI don\u0027t follow why this change is necessary in the first place. Do you have more context, like maybe a stack trace? After reverting this commit, I am unable to get Gerrit to return a 500 by loading a project config that is missing a group in the groups file.\n\nIf someone can explain more fully about the problem this change is fixing, I can think of a few workarounds for the null UUID problem, but as it is I want to understand the issue better before proceeding.",

      "message": "Regardless of whether there is a bug that this change is intended to fix, the behavior of GroupList#resolve is definitely wrong. The resolve method takes a UUID and returns the cached GroupReference corresponding to that UUID. If you pass it a group with a null UUID, it will incorrectly collapse all null UUID groups together into a single GroupReference even though they may have different names.",
