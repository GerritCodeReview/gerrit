      "message": "It was showing that even before this change. I think the content length is always computed by the web server. We could try to move it to 200 and see if that carries a content-length header.\n\nBut: I think we are chasing the wrong tail here. Jetty is a standard web server and it omits the header on 204. So I\u0027d be really surprise if Chrome doesn\u0027t handle this correctly. Can you dig a bit deeper here before we take other attempts?",
