      "message": "The file search operator is by intension disabled for queries since it is too expensive to load the data and compute the match. It is only supported for watch notification since at the moment of sending the email the file information is already present and it\u0027s only one change. This means that the is:watched operator can\u0027t consider watches that include the file search operator.\n\nThis changed with the introduction of the secondary indexes which make the file information of a change quickly accessible (since it is in the index). If secondary indexes are enabled we now do support the file operator in queries. This means we should support it also for the is:watched operator but only if secondary indexes are enabled.",
