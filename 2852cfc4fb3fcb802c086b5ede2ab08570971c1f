      "message": "Now I can\u0027t remove anyone from the attention set without making other changes. I agree that there is no reason for adding someone without comments, but removing can be useful - if I add someone by mistake in the dialog, my first action is to reopen dialog and remove it. Now this is impossible and I have to use hovercard instead.\nMaybe we shouldn\u0027t be so strict and instead of disabling \"modify\"/\"send\" only show a message like:\n\"Don\u0027t change attention set only - people might not understand why you changed it. For example,  you can vote or comment.\" I am afraid we can disable some valid use case.",

      "message": "We have discussed this extensively in the \"Gerrit Attention Set\" chat room with Marian, Delphine and Gal. Sorry, I should probably have added you to the chat room, as well. :-/\n\nTBH, if you just want to remove someone from the attention set, then should maybe just click the attention icon? Or use the hovercard. I think having a tooltip on the button should be enough. I don\u0027t like a message instead of a tooltip, because then it will be very prominent again and again, while it is only interesting to read once. We also have a long documentation page about the attention set feature, which users can read, if they are confused.",
