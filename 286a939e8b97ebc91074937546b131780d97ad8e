      "message": "You don\u0027t add revisionActions.rebase here? One issue Sasa found in my delete/publish draft change, was that the container was hidden, even though it shouldn\u0027t be. So basically for now, before all buttons are rendered (when a user is logged on) we need intersection of arrays: for one we have the names of the actions we want to render and for another we have two arrays of actions (change and revision) we have read from REST handler. Bur there is no performant array intersection in JS.\n\nThis is a non-issue for this change, though, because when rebase is visible, then Abandon is visible too. That why it worked for you.",

      "message": "I tested this series and found two issues:\n\n* 1. After clicking on Rebase button and selecting to rebase to the tip of the current branch, the rebasing works as expected, the change is reloaded, but the Rebase button disappears. After manually reloading the change with Ctrl-r in this state, Rebase button appears again, as disabled.\n* 2. With follow-up change after publish draft revision, Rebase button preserves \"Rebasing...\" state. Not sure, if this is an issue of the follow up change, though.\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/74823",
