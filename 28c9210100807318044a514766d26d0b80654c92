I wonder if this would be the time to make this change- or at least be consistent within api/.",

You could also register it with both names, and mark the all caps one as deprecated, to reduce churn for folks that prefer making this change slowly.",

      "message": "Somehow Gerrit submitted while I was typing this reply. ???\n\nMy current plan is to migrate all plugins (and gr-diff users) to TypeScript first. That is the motivation for this change.\n\nThere are a lot of clean-ups that I can follow-up with once that is done. I am totally open to the Gerrit-\u003egerrit rename, but I would prefer to do that later.\n\nIf we do this, then I would expect to set both `Gerrit` and `gerrit` for a while until everyone is migrated.\n\nNote that we also have `window.Polymer`, which has a capital letter. Overall I agree with you, but I would say a smaller case `g` is not the biggest issue we have. :-)",
