Still, some fields might be populated from the index. For example, if you request CURRENT_COMMIT, that sets lazyload \u003d true here because we need to load the commit from the repo. All fields that we were able to reconstruct will be reconstructed from the index IIRC.\n\nI think we need to keep this as:\n\nreturn SubmitRecord.allRecordsOK(cd.submitRecords(SUBMIT_RULE_OPTIONS_STRICT)) \u0026\u0026 cd.submitRequirements().values().stream().allMatch(SubmitRequirementResult::fulfilled);\n\nUntil we upgraded our index internally.",
