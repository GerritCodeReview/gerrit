      "message": "Since v1 and v2 are typically long and contains spaces, using %s:%s format made it hard for me to see where which value started/ended. Using quotes around the %s or putting some spaces between them would help. Newlines would be nice, but newlines in text logs are always a pain.\n\nAlso, the log message only says \"Duplicate values found\" and does not say on which project and for which label. Could we add `projectState.getName()` and `t.getName()` to the log message? This would make it easier find where the duplicates are.",
