I think it would be better to fix all of them or none.\n\nYou could either start using paper-checkbox everywhere or create a common style file for checkboxes.\n\nRelative positioning for something that has vertical-align:baseline and a height that is browser dependent is very fragile. For checkboxes in the usual 20px line-height context I would instead recommend something like these styles:\n\n    position: relative;\n    top: 2px; /* (20px - 16p) / 2 */\n    vertical-align: top;\n    width: 16px;\n    height: 16px;\n    margin-right: var(--spacing-xs);",
