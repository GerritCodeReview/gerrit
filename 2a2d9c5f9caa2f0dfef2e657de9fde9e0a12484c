      "message": "Not sure if this is the correct place to comment about this.\n\nI noticed a change in the behaviour when the reviewed-flag is automatically set, which I think is related to the below code being done even if isFirst \u003d\u003d false (I\u0027m not really sure, I\u0027m just guessing here).\n\nI understand that this code sets the reviewed-flag in case the auto-review was just switched on. I think this is the expected behaviour.\n\nBut I see a problem when I do the following:\n* auto-review is switched on\n* I come to a file diff for the first time -\u003e the reviewed-flag is automatically set\n* I decide to manually unset the reviewed-flag for this file\n* I navigate to the next file diff\n* I navigate up the the change\n* now I see that reviewed-flag was set for the file for which I actually unset the reviewed-flag, before your change this was not the case",
