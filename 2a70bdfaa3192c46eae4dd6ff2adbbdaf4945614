      "message": "It may not be needed.  I originally used it, but I don\u0027t know that I will now.  It does feel more complete though to have it, it feels like you shouldn\u0027t be defining a generic event without this?   I waivered a bit between making that event an inner class of the Screen class, or making as is a top level event, but it felt like an idea that would be globally applicable to a Gerrit UI and that I didn\u0027t want to fully tie to a Screen, so I went this way.  In other words, if we ever had some other top level class similar to a Screen it might want to share a similar event.  Yes, the event would need to change in that case, but by making it external to the Screen class I felt that it was making it more generic, that it was a message that this was intended to be a global Gerrit UI idea which just happened to currently be tied to the Screen class.",
