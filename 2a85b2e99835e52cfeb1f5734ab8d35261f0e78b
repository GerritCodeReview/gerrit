The related Bazel bug, that must be quoted here: [3]?\n\nThere are number of workarounds available, here 7 workarounds from the top of my head:\n\n* Install from the source debian image: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/1.1.0/bazel_1.1.0-linux-x86_64.deb\n* Use Baselisk\n* Use older gerrit tree, before the upgrade of Bazel to 1.1.0\n* Apply your revert locally\n* Build bazel from source: git clone https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel; cd bazel; bazel build src:bazel-bin-dev and use locally built version\n* Vote +1 on the corresponding Bazel issue: [3].\n* Wait a couple of working days, until the 1.2 version is released: [4].\n* Contact Gerrit Engineering Steering committee (ESC) and ask for their help. Two gerrit ESC members are Googlers and are co-located with Bazel team in Google@MUC.\n* Reach out to Gerrit team lead in Google@MUC; he was previously on Bazel team and might be able to help to increase the priority of the correposnindg Bazel bug: [3].\n\n* [3] https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10199\n* [4] https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9983",
