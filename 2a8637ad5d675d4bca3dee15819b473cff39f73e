If the destination branch is not visible, users clicking on the hyperlinked sha1 will get 404, and the fact that the message is there still reveals that there is at least one hidden branch.\n\nAside from that, I can see this causing support requests from people who don\u0027t understand that the sha1 is on a non-visible branch.  At least when the branch name is there, users can guess that they don\u0027t have permission for that branch.",
