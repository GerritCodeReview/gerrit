If you are replying to someone that is not active on the change anymore, then we do not add them. I guess we could suggest adding them to CC in that case. But that is more of a long tail problem I find.\n\nWhether the current user is a reviewer or cc does not really matter for the logic.\n\nBut maybe I have misunderstood your concern?",
