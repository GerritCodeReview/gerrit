      "message": "Well, after day the day is over, all you really got is the gits. If you ruin those, then it\u0027s really bad. As Shawn have previusly noted, a Gerrit Administrator doesn\u0027t necessarily have access to the server, and in that light I think that destroying something in the gits become one of the more severe actions that can happen. Since that\u0027s a severe thing to happen, I think I\u0027d rather keep the warning.\n\nOTOH, the warning SHOULD be transferred when we actually refer the project owner rights with the warning in it, so I can see how it\u0027s a bit redundant.\nI have removed the second warning.\n\nDone.",
