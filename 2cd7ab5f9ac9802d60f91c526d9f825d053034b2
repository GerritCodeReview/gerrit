I think that would be very appreciated (at least by our users).\n\nI found this while writing an issue for the dashboard, so there is a related issue for it.\n\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d16403",

It would be nice to have WIP/Active, Private/Public, Abandon/Restore, etc eventually.\n\nBefore adding more we need to change up the UI to be some kind of dropdown list of actions instead of having separate buttons for each one, otherwise it would get too crowded with more actions.",
