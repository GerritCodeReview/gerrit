      "message": "This may be a performance regression on sites where a submit rule requires the PatchSet object on the ChangeData. This may actually be fairly common, as anything that requires the patch list (e.g. filename predicates) needs the revision ID from the patch set.\n\nBut, such a submit rule is already slow for other reasons (opens the repo, reads from the PatchListCache, etc.), so maybe this is not worth worrying about.\n\nAnd as I mentioned before, PatchSets are eventually going to be stored in the secondary index anyway.",

      "message": "Right, this is going to hurt on gerrit-review for example. The gerrit project rules use file names to look for Library-Compliance label. And our database is slow.\n\nIf we can get patch set into the secondary index soon, we might be OK with a bit of short-term pain on gerrit-review.",
