This may actually be fairly common, as anything that requires the patch list (e.g. filename predicates) needs the revision ID from the patch set.\n\nBut, such a submit rule is already slow for other reasons (opens the repo, reads from the PatchListCache, etc.), so maybe this is not worth worrying about.\n\nAnd as I mentioned before, PatchSets are eventually going to be stored in the secondary index anyway.",
