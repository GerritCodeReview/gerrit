      "message": "After banging my head against a wall I was unable to fix just this sad ProjectCache usage without also touching all the allow(...) lines in this file (to wrap them in a try/catch that actually updated the project in the repo manager). That in turn would have made a very painful merge conflict when rebasing the change to inline all the allow methods.\n\nSo I took a different tack: I fixed the test setup and inlined all the method calls in a single new change, I61f4a6a19. Thus this file is reverted in later patch sets of this change.",
