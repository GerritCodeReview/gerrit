      "message": "This is just an arbitrary extension point that is invoked when a REST call for a change is done, so that we can check that the logging tag with the project name is set, when this extension point is invoked after a /changes/\u003cid\u003e/... REST call is done. This tests that /changes/\u003cid\u003e/... properly populates the project field in RequestInfo.\n\nIt\u0027s only used by a single test, so I moved the registration of this listener to that test. I hope that makes it clearer how it\u0027s used.\n\nThere was also a bug in that test. It\u0027s supposed to do a /changes/\u003cid\u003e/... REST call that triggers a change index, so that we can do the assertion of the logging tag in our test ChangeIndexedListener, but the test did a GET request that didn\u0027t result in an index. This is fixed now. FYI the test passed before, because the test setup (change creation) triggered the extension.",
