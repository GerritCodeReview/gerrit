What critical security vulnerabilities or other critical issues need to be fixed?\n\nWell, fed0ab9ba produced a deadlock, which is a critical issue IMHO.\nThe fact that we discovered only on master was just a coincidence: it could have happened in any use-case.\n\n\u003e In a couple of weeks\n\nWe typically release in May, which leaves us around 5 months of life of Gerrit v3.3 before declaring it EOL.\n\n\u003e we will release next gerrit release: 3.6 and 3.3 release line will be discontinued. As you can see, from the list of JGit\u0027s commits in the commit message: two commits introduced critical regressions.\n\nThe bug fixed by fed0ab9ba has been there for a very long time, however, it would make sense to fix only on non-EOL releases of Gerrit IMHO.",
