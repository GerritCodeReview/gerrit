      "message": "\u003e We should stop introducing critical regressions on most stable Gerrit release lines.\n\nI don\u0027t think anyone intends to introduce regressions of any kind on any branch. Do you think otherwise?\n\nhttps://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/187910 provides a very significant performance improvement for typical Gerrit repo scenarios.\n\nhttps://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-processes.html#dev-in-stable-branches is a bit vague on what\u0027s actually acceptable on a stable branch. One line says \"only bug-fixes and documentation updates\" and then the very next line starts a section detailing which \"new features could be acceptable\". I welcome additional guidance (aka updates to the doc pushed for review) that maintainers can agree upon.\n\nThe reality is that many/most Gerrit instances are not running the latest version. Partially that\u0027s because of concerns with stability and performance when upgrading. I think improving stability and performance on a stable branch makes it more likely admins will choose to upgrade sooner, because it\u0027s almost always less risky to go from one minor release to the next (3.3.5 -\u003e 3.3.6). Many instances hold off on even simple updates like that because of concerns. We want admins to upgrade and I think carrots are better than sticks (and I don\u0027t think we have a stick).",
