      "message": "I don\u0027t think this change is requiring Java 1.8...?\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t appreciate your insinuation that Google is being lazy. First of all, Java 8 final was released in March 2014, so nobody\u0027s been delaying \"for a year or two.\"\n\nSecond of all, Google plans to migrate _all_ of its Java code running in _all_ its datacenters to Java 8 within roughly 1 year after the release date. You\u0027d be hard pressed to find a company with a similar sized codebase and number of machines with such an ambitious upgrade schedule. We are not being lazy, it is simply a hard problem.",
