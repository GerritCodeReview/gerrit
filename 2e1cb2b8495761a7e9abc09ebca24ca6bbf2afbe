      "message": "Shawn, I have to ask if this is thread safe. I was reading about issues with the \"Double-Checked Locking\" pattern [1] and I can see that in other places where this pattern is used (e.g. in DispatchCommandProvider.getMap()) we make this pattern safe by declaring the member variable as volatile. I\u0027m wondering if putting a value into the cache is volatile or are we safe here by other means?\n\n[1] http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html",
