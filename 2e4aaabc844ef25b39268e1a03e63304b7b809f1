      "message": "I agree with Jonathan. Concrete things to do:\n\n* LICENSE-silk_icons should contain the two paragraphs Jonathan said above, *plus* the contents of exactly that link (the non-us version). Then the license of silk_icons can be just that file.\n* Diffy should use the unported version.\n* Rename this file LICENSE-CC-BY3.0-unported to clarify the version.\n\nSilk \u0026 Diffy are the only two packages that use this license, so those suggestions should cover all applicable cases.",
