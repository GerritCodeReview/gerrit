      "message": "I think you may not have thought about \u003cgr-diff\u003e being a fully independent component that can be used in various review tools?\n\n`diff-model` is a model inside \u003cgr-diff\u003e, and the comments model is in \u003cgr-diff-host\u003e, which lives outside \u003cgr-diff\u003e.\n\nSo the code review app out side of \u003cgr-diff\u003e is responsible for actually creating new comment. So we have to send an event from \u003cgr-diff\u003e to its parent (for Gerrit that is \u003cgr-diff-host\u003e).\n\nBut we only want one place to know about how fire such an event. That is the diff-model. Any component within the scope of gr-diff should be able to have the diff-model injected, and then call `createComment()` on it when they want.",
