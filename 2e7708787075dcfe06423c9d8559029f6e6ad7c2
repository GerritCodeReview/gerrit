      "message": "This should work IMO. We\u0027ve had trouble in the past in cases where the commit was not yet flushed to the storage, then DiffOps can\u0027t read it back. Here, we only look at a receive event which writes the commit to the storage even before we start processing in Gerrit.\n\nThe automerge commit should be created if it was not already there.",

      "message": "But the auto-merge is written in Gerrit, i.e. after we get the receive event? \n\nThe code in LHS always diffed against parent 0 (for single or multi-parent commits). The new code diffs against the auto-merge if commit has \u003e 1 parent.\n\nIn L484 we handle this gracefully by logging a warning, so we should be able to detect if validation fails.",
