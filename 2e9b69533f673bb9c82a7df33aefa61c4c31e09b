What about two comment thread components in two different places in the UI that each create a reply?\n\nAlso, how do we ensure that there is ever only one *draft*, not even considering whether it is being added or not?\n\nI am very much willing and interested into improving this, but I would feel uneasy approving this change. We have a similar situation with the question of whether comments and threads must be copied/cloned when being retrieved from the model. Ideally we would just have *one* model for all, but then we would have to separate UI state like \"collapsed\".\n\nAnyway, maybe proceed with adding some this.reporting.shouldNeverHappen() calls, letting that run for a week and then being sure that this actually never happens (and convert the call into throwing an error).",
