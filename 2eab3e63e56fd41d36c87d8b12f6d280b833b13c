      "message": "I think you need to check the visibile flag on the control first. This is checked in GroupsCollection.parse() for the HTTP REST API.\n\nBut, you are actually starting to try to mirror the REST API in the SSH interface. That\u0027s good. Unfortunately I don\u0027t want to write a ton of these commands like this. I would sort of prefer to have a more dynamic mapping like RestApiServlet does over HTTP, but for SSH.\n\nSo this might actually be `gerrit groups UUID members`? Its a lot of work to define the mapping in SSH. But I think its the right thing to do.",

      "message": "Right, the group visibility has to be checked. This is done in the new patch set.\n\nHaving `gerrit groups UUID members` makes totally sense to me. Though I\u0027m not sure what all needs to be done to support this kind of mapping in SSH. If I understand it correctly at the moment one can group commands under a parent command name, but this parent can\u0027t have own arguments and options? If this is a lot of work, we could leave this for later. Having all the REST functionality available over SSH doesn\u0027t have such a high prio. For us it is more important to make everything that is available over SSH to be available over REST.",
