      "message": "We could, but wouldn\u0027t this mean that submit rules will be executed for all involved changes, which can take very long if a topic has 100s of changes? Probably not worth doing such much computational effort just to enabled/disable the submit button, given that changes to submit requirements / labels happen rather seldom.\n\n\u003e One I recall was in the submitted together code.\n\nHmm, if this was the case, I would expect this code here to just work, because that\u0027s the exactly logic (MergeSuperSet computation) that it\u0027s invoking here. \nDo you have a code pointer? There seem to be no callers of ChangeData#setSubmitRequirements that set null. If we do this for submitted together I wonder how this can scale.",
