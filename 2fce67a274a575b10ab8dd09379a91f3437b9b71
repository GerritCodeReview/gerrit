Or add some comments to explain which properties should go to into the :host(...) rules and which should go into the .contentWrapper rule.",

      "message": "`:host(...) .content-wrapper` should be same as `.content-wrapper` right ?\nya some properties in `:host` can be moved to `.content-wrapper`, but some can not (like position related ones, z-index). I can move everything else to `.content-wrapper`.\nIts unlikely that more properties will be overwritten in the use case of gr-alert tho, since its top level dom (added to body directly instead of within some other components), usually you can only overwrite the style by either specifying some rules for `gr-alert` or use universal match (`*`) which is unlikely to have extra properties added to it.",
