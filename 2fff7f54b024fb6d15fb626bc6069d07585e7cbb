      "message": "That\u0027s intended to ensure that NoteDb is not being accessed for changes that were loaded from the index. You shouldn\u0027t overrule this, as this can result in 1 NoteDb read for every change that is returned for a search query (which is too expensive if a change query has many results). When processing change queries all data must be loaded from the index and NoteDb must not be accessed. It looks like submit requirements are not stored in the index yet? In this case, I\u0027m afraid, that we have to implement that first.",

Yes that was a hacky workaround to retrieve SRs from NoteDb instead of the index, but we should retrieve SRs in index instead.\n\nYes, SRs are not yet stored in the index. I will add a change prior to this one for this. I\u0027ll also proceed and merge I2a63f725b9f96 and predecessors since they are done.",
