It changed the method signature from\n\nScheduledExecutorService createQueue(int, String)\n\nto\n\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor createQueue(int, String)\n\n\nOn stable-2.14, the method signature was not change and I think it should not haved change here too. This commit was not included in a release yet so I think we should fix this and revert the adapdation that was done in plugins.\n\nI just realized about unneeded method signature change when people reported that latest of plugin stable-2.15 branch no longer works with 2.15.2. e.g. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d9319",
