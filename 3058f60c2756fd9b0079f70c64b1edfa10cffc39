And it is growing.\n\n@Viktar Are you perhaps referring to the fact that we have `side` and `commentSide` in the parameter list?\n\n@Becky would it make sense at this stage to refactor `side` to `isParent` or `isParentRevision` as a boolean? That way we can use the parameter name `side` to refer to \u0027left\u0027 or \u0027right\u0027 as `commentSide` does.",

The problem I faced was with some of the data bindings and the fact that when we save answers, we also send API requests/get responses back with \u0027side\u0027. So, it would be more than just re-naming parameters, we\u0027d also have to catch a few additional places as well.  I\u0027m not opposed to discussing, but would rather do this as a separate thing, perhaps, if we decide to go that route? because I think it could have a fair amount of discussion on its own.",
