This lead to situation that after installing a extension administrator need to update his server configuration (read: stop and start gerrit) to be able to actually use this extension.\n\nIf we don\u0027t document it clearly enough this could lead to lots of  bug reports about not working extension points",

The dynamic nature of plugin loading and DynamicSet/DynamicMap class will only help.\n\nIf you inject DynamicSet\u003cUiCommand\u003e into class constructor and then will use it somewhere in class, then each time this method will be called the DynamicSet will collect actual list of loaded UiCommand. If new plugin will be installed then you will have new entry in DynamicSet.\n\nThe only down side of sending this flag together with HostPageData is, that web session needs to be recreated to  see any new plugins.
