Do you have a suggestion how to rephrase it?\n\n\u003e Why not have two community managers elected by the community?\n\nAre you suggesting to have 2 non-Google community managers?\nThat would mean less work for us, so I guess it would be fine for us.\nWe thought that it\u0027s important for the community that Google commits to fund the work of at least one community manager. Also a Google community manager may have more options to address Google-specific issues that the community might have.",
