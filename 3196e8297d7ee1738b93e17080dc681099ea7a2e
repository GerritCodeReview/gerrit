Also a Google community manager may have more options to address Google-specific issues that the community might have.\n\nMy understanding of this role is to be like you said, a sort of \"scrum-master\" and thus an arbitrator rather than a manager. Having 2 people from the community (including Googlers if elected) would make the role even more independent and less linked to any organization.\n\nI\u0027d suggest to just merge the two bullet points to \"two members, elected by the community\".\n\nI do not see the point to say \"Google\" and \"non-Google\" as Googlers are integral part of the community of contributors, maintainers, users, everything :-)",
