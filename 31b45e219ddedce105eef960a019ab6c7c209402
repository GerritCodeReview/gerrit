      "message": "Personally, I think that change messages don\u0027t necessarily correlate to certain patchsets (which is why I let patchset id be null in the schema change). For instance, the message might be regarding the change itself rather than a certain patchset. I feel that merging changes is one of these cases, even though technically it\u0027s the latest patchset being merged.",

      "message": "I am not sure I buy that reasoning.  Submit, abandon and restore buttons are all directly on a PS.  The ssh review command does not take changes, it only takes PS ids.  I think that this is likely a call for Shawn, but his design on this so far seems to point toward the idea that he thinks of the actions as being done to PSs, not changes.\n\nAlso, if I were to error one way, I would error on adding the data, it is easier to add it now and remove it later than the other way around.  Do you see anything harmful in adding this data?",
