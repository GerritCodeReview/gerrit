      "message": "@ekempin@google.com pointed out to me that this is used by the code-owners plugin on master: https://cs.opensource.google/gerrit/gerrit/plugins/code-owners/+/master:java/com/google/gerrit/plugins/codeowners/backend/config/CodeOwnersPluginConfiguration.java;l\u003d58\n\nThe usage on line 58 is a single cache entry; however, the usage on line 72 is again a per-project entry. Perhaps we should find a way to make the PerThreadProjectCache more generic such that its limit applies to how many projects to cache and callers can store multiple different cache entries per-project? That wouldn\u0027t be helpful if the projects don\u0027t overlap, but they probably do?",

Done.\n\n\u003e The usage on line 58 is a single cache entry; however, the usage on line 72 is again a per-project entry.\n\nPost merging this change, I think we can update code-owners plugin to use PerThreadProjectCache.\n\n\u003e Perhaps we should find a way to make the PerThreadProjectCache more generic such that its limit applies to how many projects to cache and callers can store multiple different cache entries per-project?\n\nSure, I see this as an enhancement on top of this change.
