If we add this here, we would also need to add it for all other submit actions where conflicts can appear, which would be quite some redundancy. Hence I would rather add a general note about this. Done in https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/342394\n\n\u003e with maybe a pointer to the note section you added in the last change.\n\nI would rather like to omit this, because if we add it here, we also need to add it to the descriptions of all other submit actions (except ffo).",
