      "message": "Interesting suggestion. My only issue with this is that the current label configuration for copying is not only used for upload, but also for move (limited to veto votes) and it would be confusing if label.Label-Name.copyValueOnUpload\u003d-2 is then also used on move. I feel like what you are proposing here is a good idea, but goes beyond the scope of this change.",

Since it is a new option, you should be able to code it to only do things for uploads and not moves right? If you want to add a onMove version also, that\u0027s great, but that also would seem appropriate as a follow-on change if desired.",
