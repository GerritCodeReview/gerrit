      "message": "Not super thrilled about the amount of boilerplate required just to link the JSON response up to a property; it would be nice if iron-ajax supported this directly.\n\nOTOH this component is a natural place to put some common application-specific error handling (besides just \"set the value to {}\"), so maybe it will have some more meat on it later?",

That\u0027s going to prevent a lot of stuff from rendering as expected; just silently omitting stuff like the download schemes dropdown is not really the right behavior.\n\nMaybe a fixed number of retries and then a sad robot page or something.",
