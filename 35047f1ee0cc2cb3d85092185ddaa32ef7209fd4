I\u0027m seeing some problems, though, like commit message is always empty and other files are not fully rendered in side-by-side view? Are these known issues, or some problems on my side? Should the knwon issue be mentioned in the commit message?",

      "message": "The weird thing about \"very early\"side-by-side diff prototype is, that for my  Buck change it was rendred correctly: [1]. That woke my expectation that this is done. Then i tried other changes and side-by-side diff was more or less broken. I think the known issues should be mentioned in the commit message (empty commit message issues).\n\nOne thing we should also clarify: how to run PolyGerrit against developers local Jetty Server and not gerrit-review? We need initial version of Documentation/dev-polygerrit.txt. To start with it should mention three major modes:\n\n* dev mode against production data\n* dev mode against local server\n* production mode (TODO)\n\n* [1] http://imgur.com/hENdTc2",
