I\u0027m seeing some problems, though, like commit message is always empty and other files are not fully rendered in side-by-side view? Are these known issues, or some problems on my side? Should the knwon issue be mentioned in the commit message?",

      "message": "The weird thing about \"very early\"side-by-side diff prototype is, that for my  Buck change it was rendred correctly: [1]. That woke my expectation that this is done. Then i tried other changes and side-by-side diff was more or less broken. I think the known issues should be mentioned in the commit message (empty commit message issues).\n\nOne thing we should also clarify: how to run PolyGerrit against developers local Jetty Server and not gerrit-review? We need initial version of Documentation/dev-polygerrit.txt. To start with it should mention three major modes:\n\n* dev mode against production data\n* dev mode against local server\n* production mode (TODO)\n\n* [1] http://imgur.com/hENdTc2",

I havn\u0027t suggested to start telling that project admin screen (and friends) isn\u0027t supported. My suggestion was to mention two things:\n\n* 1. commit message is never rendered\n* 2. side-by-side screen rendering is unreliable\n\n| Only one is supported in this commit. It is documented in this file.\n\nYou are wrong. Both modes that I have mentioned in my comment are supported by this commit. Have you tried to issue this command?\n\n $ go run server.go --help\n Usage of /tmp/go-build300948185/command-line-arguments/_obj/exe/server:\n  -host string\n    \tHost to proxy requests to (default \"gerrit-review.googlesource.com\")\n  -port string\n    \tPort to serve HTTP requests on (default \":8081\")\n  -prod\n    \tServe production assets\n  -scheme string\n    \tScheme to proxy requests to (default \"https\")\n\nOK, I\u0027m exaggarating, i just added -scheme option, because my local Jetty is only running on http. Here is the line that i added to server.go: [1]. Now starting gerrit_daemon.launch in Eclipse, and Voila! PolyGerrit is up and running against my local data and I can debug in Eclipse as usual: [2]. But the point is, it\u0027s not a reviewer or a developer duty to find it out, but change owner should document the modes that supported by this commit.\n\n* [1] server.go patch: http://paste.openstack.org/show/478131\n* [2] PolyGerrit up and runing against local data in eclipse: http://imgur.com/jHn2bEo",
