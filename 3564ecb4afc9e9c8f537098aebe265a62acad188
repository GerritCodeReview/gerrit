Pushes to refs/for/* are always fast-forwards because the server never advertises refs with that prefix.\n\nI agree with Alice\u0027s concern however. I think it\u0027s possible to use a mechanism other than passing -f to \"git push\" to imply \"forcing\". Something like \"git push -o edit HEAD:refs/for/master\" to push an edit, which would fail if there is an existing edit; and \"git push -o overwrite-edit HEAD:refs/for/master\" to overwrite an existing edit.\n\nThough honestly, my concern with this approach would be that people will just learn to always type \"overwrite-edit\", because that\u0027s what you want most of the time anyway. A person who has learned to always type \"overwrite-edit\" no longer gets any safety from this feature.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what the best solution is here. However, since it seems like figuring this behavior out is just a detail of push option handling in the protocol, I don\u0027t think settling on a best solution needs to block the rest of the implementation.",

It sounds like to me, that their really are two new primary features that need to be built 1) change edits (for new changes, not just existing changes), and 2) private changes.  Both of those seem like nice independent features that can be developed. \n\nSo far, most of this document has been written from a migration perspective, but it might be nice to also have a section which outlines these 2 new features (if that is really what is being proposed) as new features, ignoring migration a bit, just to make sure it is well understood what you will be building.  In other words, what are the features that as a user I can expect pretending that the draft feature never existed?",
