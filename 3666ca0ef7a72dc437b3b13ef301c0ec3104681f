Right now it\u0027s \"Some person would like someone else to review \u003cA new capitalized sentence in the imperative mood\u003e\" which seems odd.\n\n(I\u0027m fine with the other bold removals in this change.)",

If Dave replies to something, a message comes from Dave. There’s no need to repeat the fact that Dave took action. It’s implied.\n\nI say emulate Critique more closely, here, without the greetings on follow-up messages. Feel free to grab me for an offline discussion if need be.",

      "message": "@Dave I agree. Bold is most effective in greater moderation. Done.\n\n@Andy Yes emails can be more minimal, but should optimize for legibility rather than minimality. Moreover, removing the salutation feels to me like a separate change, being that this one modifies CSS only.\n\nConsider, also, whether the commenter/action-taker that causes the email is always clear from the message headers (for every server configuration, or for every mail client). It may also be unclear when receiving a Gerrit email from a mailing list. These reasons make me hesitant to remove such info from the message body.",
