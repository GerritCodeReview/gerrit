      "message": "It feels suboptimal to fix both of these issues in one change - I am not quite sure how risky removing render-progress at this point is - I know that this will reopen a very popular bug in our internal code review system based on gr-diff, but maybe there is more than depends on this now. If we could keep this separate, we have some control and at import time and the ability to rollback if this is even worse than just slower diff rendering.",

Just stick a debounce 500 on the progress event to improve rendering performance while not causing the issue where a long synchronous render without ever updating the cursor means on long file renders users cannot start navigating with keyboard shortcuts until the entire, possibly 10000s of lines have rendered which can somethings takes dozens of seconds?",
