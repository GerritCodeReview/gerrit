But that\u0027s a separate issue that I\u0027ll try to tackle soon.)",

Would is also work if footer contains the URL and not Change-Id: [1].\n\nAnother nit, that could be solved, is the difference, how the changes in \"Related\" and \"Depends On\" are presented.\n\nIn your link, \"Depends On\" is just a Change-id, and in \"Related\" there are commit subjects.\n\nTheoretically zuul-status plugin could request commit info from the server and present the subject? But that would mean yet another client/server roundtrips.\n\nWe should also raise the question to install zuul-status plugin on gerrit-review. We use Zuul now and we use \"Depends-On:\" footers, and it rocks.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/oauth/+/273552",

So the answer sadly is no.\nBut I don\u0027t see a reason why one could not implement that.\nChange-Id is not ideal anyways, because the same Change-Id can live on\nmultiple branches/projects.\n\n\u003e Theoretically zuul-status plugin could request commit info from the server and present the subject? \n\nYes, totally! That\u0027s actually what we\u0027d want at the end of the day.\nBut a few days ago the plugin did not build, and had only a GWT UI.\nImprovements have just begun :-)",
