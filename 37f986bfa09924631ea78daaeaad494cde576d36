      "message": "I see what you are trying to do here, but I disagree with the definition format. I\u0027m not a fan of using reflection to invoke the method on ChangeData, this tends to be brittle if we don\u0027t have a small unit test to verify every definition is correct and working.\n\nIts somewhat messy, but I had thought we were going to do something like having a FieldDef with subclasses of SingleFieldDef and RepeatedFieldDef that are type parameterized for the return type. If these are abstract and have a T get(ChangeData) that you implement by anonymous classes for each field we can get compile-time type checking.\n\nAs for finding the fields to verify the schema, use reflection to loop through the fields declared in ChangeField and check the static final ones that FieldDef can be assigned from.",
