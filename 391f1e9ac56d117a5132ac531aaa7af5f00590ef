      "message": "What is the use-cases for Finalizable, except tests?\nMany gerrit elements stores references to service. I.e. removing\\replacing services is not supported in polygerrit (and requires a lot of work to support it). Do you have plan in near future to allow hot-replacing of services?\n\nIf the Finalizable is used in tests only, I can suggest another option - after each test iterate through all services like this:\n  for (service: getServices(...)) {\n     if (\u0027__test_only_finalize\u0027 in service) {\n       service.__test_only_finalize();\n     }\n  }\nThe main code remains almost unchanged and all cleanup logic are in tests. Also, it is clear for a reader, that the __test_only_finalize is called only in tests.",
