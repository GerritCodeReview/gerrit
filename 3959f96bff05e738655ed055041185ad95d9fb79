      "message": "A few questions:\n\n1. How does this handle topics?\n\n2. If you handle topics, how do you handle the case where there are multiple CLs / projects? Ideally, we want to be able to configure a different merge target branch for each source project/branch.\n\n3. If you don\u0027t handle topics, how do you recommend clients handle multi-CL stacking? E.g., suppose that a user upload separate stacks of CLs in the same topic and we want to merge them both to the same project/branch. How do we do this and handle the situation correctly, particularly in dry-run mode where we aren\u0027t creating CLs?",
