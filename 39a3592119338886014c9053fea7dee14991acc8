Actually I\u0027m fine with \u0027Application Error\u0027 and I think we should have it here since we have it for all the other error message as well. What I was complaining about was \u0027Application Error - Internal Server Error\u0027 as it was before. Sorry, I think I was not really clear in that comment, but actually I disliked only the \u0027Internal Server Error\u0027 part of the error message, because \u0027Internal Server Error\u0027 really means that something unexpected happened in the server.
