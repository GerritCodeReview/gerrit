I don\u0027t think it should, since it\u0027s computed.\n\nI wasn\u0027t 100% sure if these attributes could be null (and some tests were failing), so I added this. \n\nchangeTable definitely shouldn\u0027t so I suppose can remove the check, but labelNames I\u0027m not sure? Does anyone know if labelNames could possibly be null or if would return an empty array?",
