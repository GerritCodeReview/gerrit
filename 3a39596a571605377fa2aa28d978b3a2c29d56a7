      "message": "I\u0027ll confess to not having read this method thoroughly, but this is a lot of logic to be pinning in the Lucene implementation. Would it make more sense to have a static factory in LabelPredicate that returns something compound rather than a bare IndexPredicate? We already do this for e.g. ChangeStatusPredicate. And that way this logic can be more effectively reused by other index implementations.",
