If I understand your explanation below, you are not adding support for a standard git submodule feature, but rather you are adding a Gerrit specific enhancement to make the use of Submodules more easy for a certain use case.  Perhpas a good summary would be:  Allow superprojects to subscribe to submodules updates.",
