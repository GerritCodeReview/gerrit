If I understand your explanation below, you are not adding support for a standard git submodule feature, but rather you are adding a Gerrit specific enhancement to make the use of Submodules more easy for a certain use case.  Perhpas a good summary would be:  Allow superprojects to subscribe to submodules updates.",

If so, have you discussed this idea at all with the git submodule authors to ensure that it does not conflict with any of their plans?  If this is a custom field, then you should probably make that more explicit here, and the documentation should probably be updated to explain how Gerrit supports the field: what it will do with it, and how to define it (sample format).",
