      "message": "I really fail to see why this is so bad.\n\nEach GWT plugin needs to add its UI elements by\n\n  RootPanel.get(SOME_ID).add(...)\n\nIf this is bad, do we have an issue with GWT plugins in general?\n\nTo be able to add UI elements Gerrit must provide an element with a unique ID so that the plugin can lookup this element. Having an extension screen which provides an element with the ID that is requested by the plugin via the /x/MY_ID URL looks quite elegant to me.\n\nAll we do now is to attach the plugin UI elements to the screen when /x/MY_ID is loaded:\n\n  RootPanel screenPanel \u003d RootPanel.get(MY_ID);\n  if (screenPanel !\u003d null) {\n    screenPanel.add(p);\n  }\n\nor do the same when the user clicks on a menu item that is defined by the plugin.\n\nIf this is wrong, it\u0027s likely also wrong what we already do to open a dialog box from a plugin when the user clicks on a plugin menu?\n\nDo you have any alternative ideas how a plugin can add a screen to Gerrit? At least I have tons of ideas what plugins could do with this.",
