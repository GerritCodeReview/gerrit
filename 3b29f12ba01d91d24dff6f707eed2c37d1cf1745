I like to stay consistent with the code around the changes I make when I add functionality.\n\nI know that it doesn\u0027t conform to our project-wide standards, but I tend to put more stock in local conventions than project wide ones if they seem deliberate. Would you prefer I change both?",

(Is it?) But because there is a reason behind it, I guess it can stay.\n\nNot opposed to changing them both either. :-)\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/84590/1/polygerrit-ui/app/elements/change/gr-change-view/gr-change-view.html#140",
