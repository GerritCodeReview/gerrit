If the change state is changed, and hence the submit rule delivers a new result, the change is reindexed, and hence the submit requirement in the change index is up-to-date.\n\nIn my opinion, writing a submit rule for which the result depends on non-change factors is a bad practise.",

For example it\u0027s possible to add a rule that a certain label is required.\n\nWe have a test that does something like:\n\n- create changes\n- assert that the changes are submittable (and there are no \u0027requirements\u0027)\n- update the rules to require a certain label\n- assert that the changes are not submittable (and the \u0027requirements\u0027 are included)\n\nWe found that the second assertion fails when using the change query to get the changes, but not when getting each change directly.",
