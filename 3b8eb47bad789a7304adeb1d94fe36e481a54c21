      "message": "Getting back to this: We don\u0027t depend on Lucenen anymore, but are still on old index schema versions for accounts and groups. That will change later this year, but I think you don\u0027t want to wait for it.\n\nHere is what we could do:\n- For changes, all modifications are fine because we are past the version that added the new field. I just left comments to keep our current version def around.\n- For accounts, groups: I suggest reworking the ID predicates to just check if the new ID_STR field is in the schema, use that for matching if so. That allows you to remote all checks for numeric ID types. For lucene, you can add a checkState that the version is at least X or that the ID_STR field is there. So you can upgrade lucene past the version that needs string IDs.\n\nWDYT?",
