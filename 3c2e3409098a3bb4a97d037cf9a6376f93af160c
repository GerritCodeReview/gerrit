When this was embedded in a class as a private function, that was passable, but here as a public utility it just doesn\u0027t seem like a good idea.",

I need to have a closer look, but I hope I can simply use these methods, so that this change here can be abandoned. Not sure yet, when I have time to pick up this change series again.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/30788",
