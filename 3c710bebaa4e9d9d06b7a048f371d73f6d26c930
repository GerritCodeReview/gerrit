This slows down the common case where you didn\u0027t load the data from the parent revision because it was included in your own request.\n\nMaybe write a helper method that does the merge the way you do below on line 186 and use it in all 4 locations? Something like:\n\n  NativeMap\u003cJsArray\u003cCommentInfo\u003e\u003e merge(\n      NativeMap\u003cJsArray\u003cCommentInfo\u003e\u003e dest,\n      NativeMap\u003cJsArray\u003cCommentInfo\u003e\u003e in) {\n    if (dest \u003d\u003d null) {\n      return in;\n    } else {\n      ... copy data ...\n      return dest;\n    }\n\n  drafts \u003d merge(drafts, in);\n  published \u003d merge(published, in);",
