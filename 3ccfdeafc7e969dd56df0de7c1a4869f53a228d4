      "message": "\u003e IIRC we also retry in RestApiServlet? \n\nYes.\n\n\u003e Do these retries sum up (meaning 3x retries in rest API servlet + 3x retries in \n\u003e group cache loader if the group index has issues)?\n\nYes, I think they do sum up. I guess if we are much concerned about this, this is something we could fix, e.g. no retry on top-level, if retrying on low-level didn\u0027t help.\n\n\u003e If so, should we move from top-level retrying to low-level retrying only?\n\nNo, we shouldn\u0027t drop the retrying on top level, since most errors can occur outside of low-level retry blocks.\n\nIn this particular case the group cache loader is also used outside the top-level retrying, so that without the low-level retrying it wasn\u0027t retried at all.",
