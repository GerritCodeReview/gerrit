I\u0027m pretty open to extension points, but this feels especially niche. For example, why wouldn\u0027t this be a small UI plugin that only provides this functionality? Then core would only need to support plugin UI elements in the location you want to put this (and then we have the benefit that other plugins with different purposes could use that location too).",
