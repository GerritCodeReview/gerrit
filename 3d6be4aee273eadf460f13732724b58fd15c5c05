      "message": "I want to get another pair of eyes on this. We have a team meeting tomorrow morning, and we\u0027ll get someone to look at this.\n\nI\u0027m personally worried that code executing within a ReadonlyWindow (eg. an event listener) could execute ref updates, which would lead to confusion all around.  Is there a way such that executing a BRU or RU from here would throw an exception?\n\nIs this for some plugin, or does the firing itself trigger the ref loads?",
