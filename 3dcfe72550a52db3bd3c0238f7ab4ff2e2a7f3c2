I also don\u0027t see very much benefit from having the key serializer in this class. We rather have some drawbacks: EntryTypes can\u0027t be singletons anymore and we need an explicit cast for the key serializer in case of strings.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/173115/2//COMMIT_MSG#10",

      "message": "I agree that it\u0027s not necessary to have the key/value serializers returned by these methods. However, due to the issues I described in [1], I think the cleanest way forward will be to pass the keySerializer to the ObjectKeyTypeImpl constructor, even though this means there won\u0027t be a singleton KeyType.\n\nIn the long term, frankly, I would much rather get rid of the KeyType/StringType dichotomy and just store all String-valued keys as UTF-8 bytes. I really don\u0027t think it\u0027s buying us anything, and it\u0027s unnecessarily complicating the code. I don\u0027t think admins frequently manually query the cache databases, and even if they do, surely they can manage casting the byte array columns to strings using SQL.\n\nWith that in mind, even though having non-singleton KeyTypes is suboptimal, I\u0027d prefer to keep it that way in the short term.\n\n(Still totally fine with removing these methods from this class.)\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/173550/1/java/com/google/gerrit/server/cache/h2/StringKeyTypeImpl.java#b42",
