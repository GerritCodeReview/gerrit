      "message": "Generally, I wonder if this should be dependent on the context setting used around changes, e.g. as a percentage. If as a user I want to see 10 lines of context in both directions, hiding 5 lines probably seems unnecessary; if I instead have a very aggressive setting of only 2 lines of context in either direction, hiding 5 lines is probably expected.\n\nBut also LGTM as is; most users probably never tweak those settings anyway, so my point might be moot / too complicated to be worth it.",
