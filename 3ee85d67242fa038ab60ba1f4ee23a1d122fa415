      "message": "Assume a Gerrit user is active in several projects. Seeing different change screens (actually different dashboards) in different changes may not be what every user would find helpful.\n\nI think the idea of showing a new dashboard on the change screen would be more useful if every user decides what he wants to see in that dashboard. Therefore, I can ensure that I always see the same dashboard (one which is useful for my reviewing style) on all change screens regardless of the project. A user probably knows better which dashboard is helpful for him than the project owners can assume.",

      "message": "I agree with this some of the time.  I think that in general if admins are positioned to setup sane defaults for most people that they should.  This potentially prevents a lot of effort duplication (one admin versus every user).  However, naturally there are times when users will know better.  I think the latter case is an add on feature for the future when we have better user customizations for dashboards in general.",
