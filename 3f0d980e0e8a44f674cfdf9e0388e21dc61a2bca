      "message": "Good catch. I was even the one who wrote that comment in the bug.\n\nHowever, at this point, I don\u0027t see a nice way to prevent voting on non-latest patches (at least, in the way I suggested in the bug):\n* Do we only disable the [Send] button when voting on a non-latest patch? Even if all the other carefully crafted comments are totally fine to post? Feels mean to disable the [Send] button until you un-vote.\n* Would vote buttons be disabled _while_ it\u0027s checking for latest? That check can be very slow sometimes.\n* Or would vote buttons be disabled _after_ checking latest. Feels mean to take away buttons that were available for a brief time.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve done instead (in PS2) is specialize the wording of the warning message when a vote is selected. IMO, this does a better job of communicating the risk of such a vote to the user.\n\nLet me know what you think.",
