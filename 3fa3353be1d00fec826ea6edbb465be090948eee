      "message": "Yes, it looks like that first approach cause a regression. Regression was related to the fact that we invalidated the cache when project was fully setup. But `refs/meta/config` ref-updated event wasn\u0027t processed by restricted listeners. The reason why is because `google/gerrit/server/events/EventBroker.java#L168` is checking if project exists and at that point we still had negative caching.",
