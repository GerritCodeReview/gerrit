If different steps are required for other distros, these should be added in the script\u0027s header with another commit on github/facebook/buck",

Every tool is shipped with its own, Git even with two:\n\n ls \"/etc/bash_completion.d/\" | grep -i git\n git-prompt.sh\n git.sh\n\nSo, it doesn\u0027t hurt to be more specific here.",
