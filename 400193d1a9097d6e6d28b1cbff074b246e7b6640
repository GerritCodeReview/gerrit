So far the are just 4:\n  NONE, OWNER, OWNER_REVIEWERS and ALL.\n\nhowever, what\u0027s the point of emailing OWNER when a new patchset is created?\nIdeally, I\u0027d want to have NONE and REVIEWERS, but that requires yet another value, which doesn\u0027t seem like a great idea.\n\nRight now i treat any value other than NONE as \"send_email\u003dTrue\".",
