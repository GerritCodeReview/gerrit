      "message": "Context on why we implemented it that way: for \u0027has:drafts\u0027 and \u0027has:stars\u0027 their corresponding ref patterns are stored in the All-Users repo. For those, we were able to afford implementing these queries as a ref-prefix scan pre-search, getting the change IDs containing drafts (from the ref names), and sending an OR\u0027ed query of the change IDs to the change index.\n\nFor \u0027has:edit\u0027 we cannot do the same thing because edits are stored in the project repo containing the edit. This means that answering the \u0027has:edit\u0027 query in a similar way means that we need to open all repos on the host, and search in each one for ref-edits for the user.\n\nWe are reworking this idea by only allowing people involved in the change {owner, reviewer, CC} to suggest edits. With that, the query is translated to:\n  is:open AND (caller-is-owner OR caller-is-reviewer OR caller-is-CC) AND post-filter-has-edits",
