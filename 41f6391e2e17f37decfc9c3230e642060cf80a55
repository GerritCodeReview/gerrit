      "message": "I believe that we are attempting to use review_site now to describe this location, but both are used in this doc still:\nhttps://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/install.html\n\nTo be honest, I don\u0027t like either.  Don\u0027t most of us call our site_paths \"gerrit\" or something like that, it seems like a better sample name for the main directory?  And for the variable, why not use $GERRIT_HOME, it just seems to be more intuitive to me, more unixy?",

      "message": "Yes, I agree that we have an inconsistency in the documentation here. I like the proposal of using $GERRIT_HOME.\n\nFor this change I tried to keep that naming at least consistent within this file. At line 377 the same syntax is already used, calling it \u0027site_path\u0027.\n\nIf we agree on a name, we should have one change that cleans this up in the whole documentation.",
