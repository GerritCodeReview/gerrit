      "message": "Oh right, I guess I confused here something. You are right that there is the special category for creation of annotated tags. For creation of signed tags there should be also an own category (which is still missing).\n\nI would propose to simply remove this example for assigning the \u0027Create Reference\u0027 privilege on \u0027refs/tags/*\u0027. It seems to make not much sense (maybe it does for leightweight tags, but even if it does I\u0027m not sure that this case deserves to be explicitly mention here).\n\nSorry for the confusion.",

      "message": "But it seems so smart to allow one category of tags as the create reference.. if you say there should be a specific signed-category, then create reference could be interpreted as allowing all three kinds of tags, including light weight?\n\nMaybe that in contrast deserves a separate paragraph.. ?\n\nHmm. Hard to decide really. Anyone know what the code says about this? What happens if I grant Create Reference in refs/tags/... ?",
