      "message": "As you\u0027re saying \"constant\" and not variable, I assume that you mean that I should put this example file content into a constant of this test class. I deliberately didn\u0027t do that. One main reason was to make each test self-explanatory. If we just had situations where a line was added at the end, we could of course use a constant as you suggested and still have self-explanatory tests. Even then, I would probably still prefer just a very short file content like \"Only line\" as that would be more explicit. The latter is what I did for the existing tests in this class. I went over the new tests again to make the necessary content as short as possible while still having the tests pass (background: the rename/copy behavior requires that we have enough file content which stays similar).",
