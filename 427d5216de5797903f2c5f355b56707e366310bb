To learn this process properly, I\u0027m scripting locally to test my assumptions first. This is also based on [2], which I\u0027m not using directly yet. I should dry-run it too someday soon. More to come as I dry-run [1], then; nothing definitive yet.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.12/dev-release.html#publish-gerrit\n[2] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit-ci-scripts/+/refs/heads/master/jenkins-docker/slave-release/gerrit-release.sh\n",
