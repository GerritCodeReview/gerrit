Our internal version of page.js is causing an issue from my test run.",

      "message": "Just an idea that could also work and might be simpler:\n\nMaybe Gerrit FE could be configured (by another default rule) to redirect from gr-app.js to a dedicated gr-app.mjs file that we actually keep as a submitted file to the repo instead of creating it on the fly.\n\nNote that we also have a dedicated `gr-app-entry-point.ts` file for creating the rollup bundle. Maybe that can be used/shared?\n\nMaybe it is obvious for you why this does not work, and you have already tried that. :-) Feel free to just close then.",
