      "message": "I thought about that, but since I need to copy multiple files and then \"chown\" them I thought it would have been better to keep the 2 commands in a single layer. Unless you are strong about that I\u0027d leave it as it is. WDYT?",

      "message": "I am not against leaving it as it is. At the moment it doesn\u0027t make a difference, since we copy whole directories: There are two layers with the same file (the respective COPY layer and this RUN layer). Less is thus impossible. It just seemed unnecessary to copy them around. I would have suggested:\n\n  ARG gatling_home\u003d/home/gatling\n  RUN addgroup -g 1000 -S appgroup \u0026\u0026 \\\n        adduser -u 1000 -S gatling -G appgroup -h $gatling_home\n\n  COPY ./src/test/scala/com/google/gerrit/scenarios $gatling_home/user-files/simulations\n  COPY ./src/test/resources/application.conf $gatling_home/conf\n  COPY ./src/test/resources/data $gatling_home/user-files/resources/data\n  RUN chown -R gatling:appgroup $gatling_home\n\nThis doesn\u0027t reduce the number of layers with a version of the files, but is just a more direct way of doing this.\nBut that is optional.",
