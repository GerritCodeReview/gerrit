I don\u0027t think it applies to #1, which is what this change is working towards.\n\nDoes that help clarify? (we\u0027ll be sure to update the commit message if it does)",

This allows for plugins to provide policies with the minimal amount of work both in core, and for the plugin. This need not be the final solution, but I suspect it is a minimal \"good enough\" implementation that does not break user expectations, and allows for plugins to start providing policies (which is Qcom\u0027s objective). This does not provide a user interface to make finer grained selections available to users, but it does allow for such an interface still to be built by anyone desiring it.",

      "message": "It seems like you think that some sort of rule system would be better than plugins. I am going to respectfully disagree. In this case a rule based system would need to be extremely complicated to meet both your use cases and our cases, as they are very different. Your use cases seem related to letting a user configure rules for themselves, whereas our use cases are related to letting our lawyers dictate to our users which email to use and when. There is a chance that our lawyers may need information from custom internal systems at some point, and that would not likely be feasible to do without a plugin. I currently believe a plugin system meets our needs best.\n\nAs a Gerrit maintainer my philosophy for Gerrit has always been to generally approach new exotic and generic use cases by 1) adding an extension point to core 2) implementing new exotic + generic policies in plugins 3) promote generic plugins to core plugins if they prove to be useful to many users.\n\nIn this case, our policies are somewhat exotic, so we won\u0027t likely be pursuing any generic solutions. But perhaps you will?",
