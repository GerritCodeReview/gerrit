      "message": "I\u0027ve recently studied the JGit bitmap code, and I can\u0027t help but wonder if this cache is still necessary. The JGit reachability bitmap has the info to answer the question \"does commit C have a path to tags T1...TN\" without doing a revwalk (for recent commits C). I wonder if you could simplify things by using ObjectReader.createReachabilityChecker() (which uses bitmaps in the background) to compute TagSets instead?",

      "message": "That might be an option and I can look at trying that in a later change. It obviously would require admins to maintain up to date git bitmaps to have a performant system and I don\u0027t yet know enough about that to know if there\u0027s a trade-off or other side-effects it would introduce. This change and the ones following it should make a refactor to use jgit reachability objects easier (as well as providing a memory use improvement), so I don\u0027t think we should block these changes from going in now. Any concerns with that?",
