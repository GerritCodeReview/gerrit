      "message": "I\u0027ve recently studied the JGit bitmap code, and I can\u0027t help but wonder if this cache is still necessary. The JGit reachability bitmap has the info to answer the question \"does commit C have a path to tags T1...TN\" without doing a revwalk (for recent commits C). I wonder if you could simplify things by using ObjectReader.createReachabilityChecker() (which uses bitmaps in the background) to compute TagSets instead?",
