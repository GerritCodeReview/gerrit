      "message": "Can you clarify if this supposed to support the reindex program? I saw discussion i this change and that patch set 4 took different approach, trying to use TrackingValueExtractorProvider to load a class from lib directory and use it (similar to how secure store is working). In the later patch sets this approach seems to be  replaced with plugin-only approach, and thus reindex program that currently doesn\u0027t load plugins wouldn\u0027t be able to respect custom tracking id extactor?",
