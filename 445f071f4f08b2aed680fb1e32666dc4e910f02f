It really just performs the same matching in the predicate that the index backend already performs today. Do you have specific concerns with a predicate where we can discuss that in more detail?\n\n\u003e Are there unit tests to test all these matches to ensure that these changes don\u0027t break them?\n\nThis logic is untested today AFICT. Id3c1d3d (later change in this series) adds a Fake index. That uses only #match functions and runs Query{Changes,Accounts,Projects,Groups} tests. So any operator so all predicates that have a test there (and that\u0027s all predicates, otherwise, it would be an oversight - code coverage analysis can tell) is tested with that change.\n\nI am happy to merge this change in lockstep with Id3c1d3d to ensure we have good coverage.",

That is because the change to the IndexRedicate seems to attempts to do it all at once. It would be easier to review for correctness if for example this started with a change that dealt with all fields of type LONG. Then a reviewer could see which other predicate changes were related to that and they could try to follow them to understand if it is doing the same thing before and after this change. Currently there is no easy way for me to tell which Predicates correspond to which field types in the IndexPredicate, so I can\u0027t evaluate the impact of the change without potentially downloading it and breaking it myself into smaller changes.\n\n\u003e \u003e Are there unit tests to test all these matches to ensure that these changes don\u0027t break them?\n\u003e \n\u003e This logic is untested today AFICT.

If this change is buggy then it becomes twice as hard to fix since someone would have to figure out how fix this change and how to fix the test.",

(2) One change per predicate that we remove/migrate towards using (1) instead of one-off matching logic.\n\nIn between (1) and (2) we put the fake index implementation from Id3c1d3d. That means that we have tested the current, per-predicate matching logic and the removal of it explicitly.\n\nWDYT?\n\nI am in favor of David\u0027s idea of removing boilerplate Predicate classes and moving them into ChangeQueryBuilder, InternalChangeQuery or ChangePredicates.",
