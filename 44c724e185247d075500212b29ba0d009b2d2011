      "message": "This isn\u0027t strictly true. The operations taking a \u0027change-id\u0027 *can* include the project name, but they aren\u0027t required to be. I see now that those other formats are considered deprecated, but I don\u0027t know that everyone in the community is on board for that. The change adding the deprecation [1] was uploaded+approved+submitted in only 80 minutes and had only one reviewer. I suspect that deprecation needs to be revisited as I can think of valid use cases for not having a project included in your change-id.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/149450",
