That\u0027s why I prefer not reloading and making sure the change is still part of the original view in which they interacted with.",

It\u0027s confusing to have different behavior for each case.\n\nAdditionally, if a change is no longer there, it may have changed in the interim so it might have been abandoned manually in a different tab.
