      "message": "This line messed up with submit requirements when I changed ChangeInfo.submittable to use submit requirements instead of submit records.\n\nsubmit requirements are evaluated by calling the match() methods of predicates. Some callers pass in ChangeData with storage constraint\u003dNOTEDB_ONLY but this predicate changes it to INDEX_PRIMARY_NOTEDB_SECONDARY. Then in ChangeInfo\n\nchangeInfo.submittable \u003d ... // now uses SRs, storage constraint was changed\nChangeInfo.labels \u003d ... // now broken because it relies on submit records \nChangeInfo.submit_records \u003d ... // empty\n\nsubmit_records are only computed for the \"NOTEDB_ONLY\" storage constraint.\n\nTo fix this, I will keep as is but just restore the storage constraint back to its original value.\n\nhttps://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/324941",
