      "message": "The internal order of the reverts within the same project and branch will always be from the descendant to the ancestor.\nIf there are unrelated changes in the same project and branch, and if there are changes within different branches/projects, I make no guarantee about the order of those reverts. \nThe order within the same branch/project, if two changes are not related as far as I understand is by update time.\nThe order within different branch/project is alphabetical by the name of the branch, and then if the branch name is the same, then it is by update time.\n\nAt any case this definitely isn\u0027t something I promise to the user, so I guess adding @UseClockStep in all relevant tests will solve the problem.",
