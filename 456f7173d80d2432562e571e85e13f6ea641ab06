Please change to:\n\n  replace(\"${URL}\", docUrl)\n\nI guess that the main reason for this reoccurring mistake is the misleading API of\nthe java.lang.String where replace/replaceAll make someone think that the first method\nreplace only the first occurrence and the second one all occurrences. Actually both of\nthese methods replace all occurrences. The first one works on normal strings the second\none on regexes.",
