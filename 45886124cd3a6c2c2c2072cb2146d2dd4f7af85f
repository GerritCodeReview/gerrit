Unfortunately, we have not been very consistent about naming (I guess things evolve).  I wish that we could come up with a pattern that is more generic.  Edwin might be able to help here, he has made improvements before. \n\nIf I look a the RemoveReviewer action, I see the following convention:\n\n Name             Use                  Example\n ...Command       Ssh                  SetReviewersCommand\n ...Service       RPC Interface        PatchDetailService\n ...ServiceImpl   RPC Implementation   PatchDetailServiceImpl\n ...Handler       RPC Handler          RemoveReviewerHandler\n ...              Main Implementation  RemoveReviewer\n\nI am not sure this is great, but I understand it better than what you\u0027ve got here and it seems a bit less wordy (simpler).\n\nIf I were to adapt it to your code, I would suggest the following changes.\n\n Name             Use                  Example\n ...Command       Ssh                  CreateProject -\u003e CreateProjectCommand\n ...Handler       RPC Handler          CreateNewProject -\u003e CreateProjectHandler\n ...

I like this naming pattern and would be happy to see this as the new standard naming pattern. If we agree on this, it\u0027s a good idea to describe it in the contributor guidelines. We should then also spend the effort to once cleanup the code and make the naming consistent.\n\nThanks Martin for starting this discussion.
