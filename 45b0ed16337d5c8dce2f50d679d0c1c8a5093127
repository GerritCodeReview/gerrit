      "message": "Should we set Content-Type: text/plain here? That\u0027s pretty much a given if it\u0027s base64. Unfortunately HTTP doesn\u0027t allow base64 as a valid Transfer-Encoding, otherwise I would recommend setting that here as well.\n\nThe reason I ask is I have I1807ce335 pending to teach RestApi to read text/plain responses. If we could also tweak that to do base64 decoding as well, all the better, but I\u0027m not sure how we would communicate that in the headers.",
