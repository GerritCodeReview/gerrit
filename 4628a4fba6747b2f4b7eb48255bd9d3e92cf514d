Hence, one will break.\n\nYou could do the rename progressively:\n1. make the frontend understand both webLinks and fileWebLinks; wait for full rollout.\n2. rename in the backend; wait for full rollout.\n3. rename in the frontend to only support fileWebLinks.\n\nThis is also a bit bad since you break everyone that use it except the frontend (probably not that many use it though) :-)\n\nI would just keep the name as is and suffer the bad naming.",
