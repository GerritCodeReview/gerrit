What we want to describe in the new page is the persistence format for the project configuration, it has not really something to do with the global Gerrit server configuration.\n\nDo you plan to include this new page into this change?

      "message": "Edwin, I never intended for owner right to be granted in All-Projects because as you state, having owner in All-Projects means you can edit the access control list, including the capabilities, and add a group you are a member of to the administrateServer and thus elevate your privileges beyond just editing the ACL. So owner is approximately server administrator, so we should not have owner in All-Projects.\n\nIf you can set owner in All-Projects through the web UI, that is a bug (but I don\u0027t think its allowed). I think if you dig through the ProjectControl code you find that the owner permission is ignored in the All-Projects case, instead using isAdministrator() (the administrateServer capability).\n\nIts worth mentioning in the access control documentation this special corner case. I think these two paragraphs do that nicely.",
