      "message": "Thanks, I wasn\u0027t aware of that change!\n\nYes, I guess this will resurrect the problem that has been fixed there, but I wonder if maybe it\u0027s less bad then the MissingObjectExceptions that we are trying to fix here.\n\nIf there are 2 parallel ref updates for creating the auto-merge ref, one succeeds and the other fails with LOCK_FAILURE. This means if you retry the push, the auto-merge ref should be already present and then the push should go through. This seems to be less severe than failing pushes due to MissingObjectExceptions that don\u0027t go away on a retry.",
