In general, there are two ways to reuse such code:\n1) Factor out that Op from the API class (PostReview) into a common place (for example the notedb package) and then reuse it from the git package.\n2) Reuse smaller chunks of work by putting these into classes in a common place (a lot of times these chunks of code end up in Util classes) and then have two Ops classes, one in PostReview and one in the git package that just use the relevant parts by calling the Utils.\n\nIn this case, (2) seems to be the better option. Most (all?) code you need is already in CommentsUtil and the event logic is also centrally handled (commentAdded.fired...).",
