      "message": "I see the following problems with this approach (if you have 2 or more feature flags):\n1) If percentage for features are the same, user has\neither all features enabled together or doesn\u0027t have any feature enabled. Later you can decide to release only one feature and there is a chance that it doesn\u0027t work separately.\n\n2) If feature flags are used for A/B testing the results can be incorrect. For example,you have 10% for a feature A and 20% for a feature B. With the current implementation this mean, that if you have feature B, then you have feature A. Opposite - if you have feature A then you have feature B with probability 50%. And there are no users with the feature A only. It is hard to make statistical analysis on such data.",
