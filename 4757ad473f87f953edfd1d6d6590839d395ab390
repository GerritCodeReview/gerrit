      "message": "All we want to achieve here, is to skip staleness check in the RepoRefCache after the change was rebuilt. Another way to express it, could be to leave this try/catch/finally unchanged, but add new method to the RepoRefCache#closeWithoutStalenessCheck, and use it here instead:\n\n  [...]\n  } finally {\n    if (newRefCache !\u003d null) {\n      newRefCache.closeWithoutStalenessCheck();\n    }\n  }\n\nThe method: closeWithoutStalenessCheck would be something like:\n\n  public void closeWithoutStalenessCheck() {\n    if (closed.getAndSet(true)) {\n      log.atWarning().log(\"RepoRefCache of {} closed more than once\", repo.getDirectory());\n      return;\n    }\n\n    repo.close();\n  }\n  \nThat would express the intent more clearly to skip staleness check as it could be false positive anyway.\n\nAlternative, you could add a comment to the extracted code block why it was extracted from try/catch/finally block.",
