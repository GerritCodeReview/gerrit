Let me try.\n\nBoth, gr-autocomplete and dropdown-content have height constraints.\n\nThe overflow:auto was actually working, but only if the 50vh constraint was hit. Otherwise it would just grow. And then dropdown-content would not need scrolling, because it is overflow:visible (the default) within gr-autocomplete.\n\nMakes sense?",
