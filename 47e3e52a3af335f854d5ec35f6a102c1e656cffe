      "message": "\u003e Primary is an adjective and therefore doesn\u0027t make sense on its own.\n\nPrimary is a noun [1], and it is that usage we mean here: \"First in importance\".\n\n\u003e Primary/replica are two terms that we introduce to avoid the inappropriate master/slave replication terms.\n\nAgreed.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e When you have multiple Gerrit \"servers\" that can all serve any type of traffic, we don\u0027t have anymore the primary/replica configuration, hence the term \u0027primary\u0027 loses its meaning because there isn\u0027t a \"secondary\" or a \"replica\" necessarily.\n\nYes, if you have that configuration. That is however, a specific configuration. Other configurations could have some of the servers as read-only, or some that only do replication, or ... (there\u0027s many possibilities).\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Why don\u0027t we just call it a Gerrit cluster?\n\nAs I note above, not all clusters are composed entirely of primaries. If it helps with this title though, I would be fine renaming it to \"Multi-primary cluster(s)\". I can also add some other \"common cluster configurations\", maybe all under a \"Gerrit clusters\" heading? I do want to respect that this is a glossary and not a how-to guide for configuring Gerrit servers.\n\n\u003e Inside the Gerrit cluster you have multiple nodes that all run the same stack.\n\u003e In front of a Gerrit cluster you typically have a workload balancer.\n\nThese are specific to a given configuration. I\u0027m trying to keep this definition quite generic. More specific definitions can be added if you want.\n\n[1] https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/primary#:~:text\u003dDefinition%20of%20primary%20(Entry%202,of%20a%20binary%20star%20system",

      "message": "I believe [1] refers to the noun \"primaries\" which is the early stage of the US presidential elections. In British english [2] it is an adjective that stays before a noun. I am fine with the term \u0027primary node\u0027 (a single Gerrit instance) or \u0027primary cluster\u0027 (a set of Gerrit instances). The term \u0027multi-primary\u0027 just does not make sense to me because the word comes from Latin (primarius) which means *the first*. Does multi-first make sense in English?\n\n[2] https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/primary_1?q\u003dprimary",

      "message": "\u003e Does multi-first make sense in English?\n\nNo, multi-first does not make sense. Does/did \u0027multi-master\u0027 make sense? Would \u0027multi-leader\u0027 make sense? (ignoring the problems with those nouns)\n\nI\u0027m happy to use different words, I just want them to be clear. Ignoring the \u0027multi-\u0027 aspect for the moment, if we had a \"Gerrit master\" before, do we not have a \"Gerrit primary\" now? Are you concerned that previously we had an implicit suffix of \u0027process\u0027 and when you s/master/primary/ it seems strange that you\u0027re not ending with \u0027process\u0027? i.e. does \"Gerrit primary process\" sound better to you?\n\nIn a document with single and multiple configurations being discussed, the single variant might be referred to as \"A single Gerrit primary process configuration (aka single-primary)\". Continuing that to \"multi-\", I would think a long version could be \"A multiple Gerrit primary processes configuration (aka multi-primary)\". WDYT?\n\nI wasn\u0027t the one who picked the word primary, but I think it\u0027s a fine choice. For full context, the link I had as [1] includes 6 definitions of \u0027primary\u0027 as a noun and I was referring to the first:\n\n Definition of primary (Entry 2 of 2)\n 1: something that stands first in rank, importance, or value : FUNDAMENTAL ‚Äîusually used in plural\n\nFrom that site as well, the origins:\n\n Noun\n \n in part borrowed from Late Latin prƒ´mƒÅrius \"person leading, leader,\" noun\n derivative of Latin prƒ´mƒÅrius \"of the highest importance or station, chief,\n PRIMARY entry 1\"; in part noun derivative of PRIMARY entry 1, or shortened from\n collocations with the adjective; (sense 5) shortened from primary election,\n earlier primary assembly, translation of French assembl√©e primaire\n\nThat does seem to indicate that it blurs the line between adjective and noun and I think that\u0027s exactly how we\u0027re using it too. We mean it generally as an adjective of \u0027process\u0027, but we shorten it for convenience.",
