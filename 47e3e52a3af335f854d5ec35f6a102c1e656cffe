      "message": "\u003e Primary is an adjective and therefore doesn\u0027t make sense on its own.\n\nPrimary is a noun [1], and it is that usage we mean here: \"First in importance\".\n\n\u003e Primary/replica are two terms that we introduce to avoid the inappropriate master/slave replication terms.\n\nAgreed.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e When you have multiple Gerrit \"servers\" that can all serve any type of traffic, we don\u0027t have anymore the primary/replica configuration, hence the term \u0027primary\u0027 loses its meaning because there isn\u0027t a \"secondary\" or a \"replica\" necessarily.\n\nYes, if you have that configuration. That is however, a specific configuration. Other configurations could have some of the servers as read-only, or some that only do replication, or ... (there\u0027s many possibilities).\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Why don\u0027t we just call it a Gerrit cluster?\n\nAs I note above, not all clusters are composed entirely of primaries. If it helps with this title though, I would be fine renaming it to \"Multi-primary cluster(s)\". I can also add some other \"common cluster configurations\", maybe all under a \"Gerrit clusters\" heading? I do want to respect that this is a glossary and not a how-to guide for configuring Gerrit servers.\n\n\u003e Inside the Gerrit cluster you have multiple nodes that all run the same stack.\n\u003e In front of a Gerrit cluster you typically have a workload balancer.\n\nThese are specific to a given configuration. I\u0027m trying to keep this definition quite generic. More specific definitions can be added if you want.\n\n[1] https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/primary#:~:text\u003dDefinition%20of%20primary%20(Entry%202,of%20a%20binary%20star%20system",
