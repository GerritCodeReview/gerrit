Some explanation why do you want to remove this small tutorial in the commit message can be helpful.",

I am adding them in the next change(change 293042), should have mentioned this in the commit message.\n\nThe main reason is that there is no point in having 2 separate dialogs.

Add the full description to the first change in the topic, so it is clear for a reviewer what is the final result.\n\n\nI downloaded the change https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/293043/3 and I think some UX improvements are required (below my opinion, maybe @Delphine has a different view - please ask her to review the change):\n1. The text in the dashboard says:\n  \u003e\u003e Pushing a change for review is easy, but a little different from other git \n  code review tools. Click on the `Create Change\u0027 button and follow the **step \n  by step instructions**.\n\nWhen I click \"Create Change\" I don\u0027t see any instructions - the dialog suggests to create a new change or view commands.\n\nEither dashboard\u0027s text or \"VIEW COMMANDS\" button should be changed.\n\n2. The workflow for \"Create change\" is not straightforward.\nClick \"Create Change\" -\u003e \"View Commands\" -\u003e execute all steps -\u003e Click \"DONE\"\nWhat should I do next? ðŸ˜• \nEnter a description and click \"Create\"? Or click \"Cancel\"?\n\nIf I enter a description first and then click \"View commands\" - the steps don\u0027t use description. Is it a bug?\nThe same with other fields (sha1, topic, private change).",
