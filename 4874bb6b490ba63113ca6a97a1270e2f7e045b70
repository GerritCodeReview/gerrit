      "message": "It looks like the HTML imports have been added back in PS15. Is this intended? The same would apply to script src attributes as well.\n\nMoreover, modifying the paths used in files that get vulcanized [1] (i.e. the majority of the component HTML and JS files) should have no effect in a built version of PolyGerrit. When we build PolyGerrit, these paths are traversed by the build process to assemble the large gr-app.html and gr-app.js files (which would not include those paths at all). These are the files which should by loaded by a deployed Gerrit instance -- not individual components.\n\n* [1] https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler",
