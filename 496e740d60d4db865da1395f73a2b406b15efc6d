      "message": "I\u0027m not sold on this UI, and am open to suggestions.\n\nThis adds another radio button in the patch history table when viewing a diff.  For merge commits, we show \u0027Common Ancestor\u0027 next to \u0027Auto Merge\u0027 (Used to be \u0027Base\u0027).  This takes up a bit of horizontal space.\n\nAnother option is to use a drop-down for Auto Merge/Common Ancestor.  I think I like the current version better and a drop-down might be confusing, but I\u0027m fine either way.  Or maybe there is another alternative I haven\u0027t thought of.",
