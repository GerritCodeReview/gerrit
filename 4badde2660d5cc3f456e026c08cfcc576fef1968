      "message": "It\u0027s probably more efficient to scan through the existingThreadEls once and insert their id into a set. That way at 736 you only have to do `if existingIds.has(thread.rootId)`\n\nSo something like. `const existingIds \u003d new Set\u003cstring\u003e(...this.getThreadEls().map(t \u003d\u003e t.roodId));`",

A map would do that.\n\nMy main concern is that this is currentyly O(N*M) and it could easily be O(M log M) + O(N log M) with a map.\n\nI\u0027m on the fence on whether this is worth the extra complexity as you mention, because there\u0027s not a huge amount of threads.  Maybe simply leave a note?",
