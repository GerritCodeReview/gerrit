      "message": "This again regresses compared to the --no-reindex option for upgrade of gerrit to newer release with bumped index schema version. Consider the case where project index schema version would be bumped. Old site: index schema version 17, new gerrit release would bump the index schema to 25. With this approach, 100,000 projects would be reindexed in init site program. Without this change, --no-reindex could be passed, and reindexing can be deferred to reindex program or to online reindexing feature.\n\nReal life example, see this change where I removed older index schema versions and bumped Lucene to new release: [1]. Note, that because of the online reindexing support, this can only be submitted during the new release is conducted. So that it\u0027s really unfortunate, that this series: [1] can not make into 3.2 release.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/178051/34",
