I\u0027ve reverted only this chunk and all upstream and internal tests pass: I119f073\n\nWhat was the background for changing this part to bind Lucene also for custom index types? It seems to go against the comment in l.229.\n\nIn any case I am happy to help getting this into the state that you want it to be in and adjust our internal code if needed.",
