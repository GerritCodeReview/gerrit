The change is on stable-2.16, which is an EOL release where people expects only security fixes (or major P0/P1 bugs fixed)\n2. The additional field is in the middle of the log, which would break people\u0027s parsing of the values\n3. The change in the format of the httpd_log isn\u0027t documented\n\nWhat would you suggest as way forward to address those concerns?",
