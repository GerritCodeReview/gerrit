      "message": "Measuring the latency is always good, however, I am concerned about three things:\n1. The change is on stable-2.16, which is an EOL release where people expects only security fixes (or major P0/P1 bugs fixed)\n2. The additional field is in the middle of the log, which would break people\u0027s parsing of the values\n3. The change in the format of the httpd_log isn\u0027t documented\n\nWhat would you suggest as way forward to address those concerns?",

      "message": "The position of thi new entry was chosen as it is, since it makes sense to put it next to other metrics (content length).\nWe introduced it into our internal fork and forgot to share this change. Since we are still on 2.16, I ported it over to stable-2.16. However, I agree that might not be the best branch. Should I rebase it on master? I would then also add the documentation.",
