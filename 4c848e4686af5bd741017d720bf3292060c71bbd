      "message": "Ah, I forgot that about MySQL.\n\nI meant to use a pool in addition to the refactor to use connections per-thread. i.e. try to get a connection for each rebuild thread from the pool. But maybe I just didn\u0027t look closely enough at the code. If I\u0027ve configured gerrit.config to use a pool, will the migrator honor those settings (from reading the code now, I think it will)?",
