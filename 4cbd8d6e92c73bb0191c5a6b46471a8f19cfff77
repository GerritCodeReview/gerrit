      "message": "I am not suggesting that we need to change them all, but I do think they are a problem in that they basically pretend to be simple getters and devs generally don\u0027t expect getters to sometimes work, and sometimes not work, it an a big potential source of bugs.\n\nI introduced a new convention for the new methods I added which throw exceptions when they can\u0027t load things, and I think we also need a naming convention for this type of function that you are adding. Whether we \"back-churn\" the new convention to existing methods, that\u0027s a separate question, and I don\u0027t think we need to answer (and certainly not implement) that here, but I am not opposed to it.",
