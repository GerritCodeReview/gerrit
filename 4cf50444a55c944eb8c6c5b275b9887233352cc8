Currently reviewers typically assume a change is \"WIP\" by its owner after they post  comments. Owners assume a change is waiting on a reviewer after they push a new patch set. This new WIP state doesn\u0027t seem to buy us anything.\n\nYou have described the mechanics of what the change gives us, but I\u0027m not sold on why I should read a 847 line code review. Why did you build this for OpenStack? How does this improve the workflow employed by the OpenStack contributors?",
