      "message": "1. replaceAll does regex compilation and matching which is not necessary for a single character replacement. This is also why a double backslash was needed in this case.\n\nUse the String.replace(char, char)?\n\n2. According to the Google Java Style Guide [1] it seems preferable to use single quotes in this case:\n\n  \u0027\\u00a0\u0027\n\n3. Seems like the comment explaining the non-printable char has to be in the same line, but I am not sure about that. \n\n[1] https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s2.3.3-non-ascii-characters",
