      "message": "Thanks for running this! Looks promising, though I find \"Passed (0 sec)\" for the build/tests a bit suspicious. At least the RBE tests seem to have run something, and have taken more than 0 seconds :-)\n\nDoes the test suite include load tests? At least large data transfers over SSH? Cloning a large-ish repo? Can we run this with\n\n  CoreModuleProperties.REKEY_BLOCKS_LIMIT.set(ssh_daemon, Long.valueOf(512 * 1024L));\n  \nset on Gerrit\u0027s server daemon? (Don\u0027t know if Gerrit has some way to configure this via a config file.) That would re-key every 512kB, which may slow down things quite a bit, but which will really stress test the KEX implementation if there are large data transfers.\n\nThe SftpTransferTest in Apache MINA sshd has a test that even re-keys every 64kB. That test runs about 5 times slower than with the default setting (1GB with the chacha20 cipher) because it re-keys basically every 1-2 SSH packets.",
