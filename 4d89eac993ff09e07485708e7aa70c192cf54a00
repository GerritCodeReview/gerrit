      "message": "That\u0027s an interesting idea. Honestly, I didn\u0027t know that group existed.\n\nI see that the docs mention it [1], but it\u0027s not very prominent in the code. I only found it in SchemaCreator and a bunch of tests.\n\nLet me think this through more deeply tomorrow and get back to you on that.\n\nDo you use the Non-Interactive group in any of your setups? If so, for what (what is done differently when a user is a member) and how is your experience with that so far?\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/access-control.html#non-interactive_users",

      "message": "I am concerned that this attempts to be too clever. While it may makes somethings easier or better when it just works, it may make things more complicated when it doesn\u0027t. I think it would generally be better to allow each individual feature to be configured with a group(s) for which it alters its behavior. This would give much finer control when needed, but would still allow for simpler solutions like this by simply having a configurable default \"robot\" group that features could point to for disabling a feature.",
