We should remove the TODO I think.\n\nCan we also add more Javadocs, so that the future reader understands why we are keeping both handlers?\n\n{@link SubmitRequirementExpressionResult} was previously serialized as a mandatory field in {@link com.google.gerrit.entities.SubmitRequirementResult}, but was later on migrated to an optional field. The server needs to handle deserializing both formats.",
