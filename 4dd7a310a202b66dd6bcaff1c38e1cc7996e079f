Is the unresolved state a \"comment\" or a \"thread\" attribute?\nI think you meant that published comments could be in a resolved state, hence filtered from porting, while draft replies on them are unresolved. The result is porting the drafts only, while the better behaviour is to port the entire thread (?)\n\nAlso, in [1] it looks like the \"unresolved\" state is evaluated per thread. Wouldn\u0027t that mean all published/drafts of the same thread have the same state?\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/281281/2/java/com/google/gerrit/server/restapi/change/CommentPorter.java#117",
