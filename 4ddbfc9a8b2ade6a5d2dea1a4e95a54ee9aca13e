What about old entries in the db, can they still have non-qualified branch names, so that the \"correcting\" code is still needed. Or do we need a migration to fix these as well?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think that is neccessary.  I beleive the current code paths preventd things from going in without \"refs/\" in front.  This just makes it easier to be sure of that for new code (and makes us not have to write new code to do this).\n\nAs a data point,  I looked on our server, and we have 24 change rows that do not start with \"refs/\" (out of 1.2M).  Those 24 are all from a short period back in 2013, I beleive we had a bad internal command at that time.  We found our pretty quickly that if you don\u0027t start with \"refs/\", the change was not visible in the UI even.  So if other people were seing this, they would likely know and have complained.",
