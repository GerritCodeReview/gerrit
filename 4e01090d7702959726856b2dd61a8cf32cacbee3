      "message": "DavidP proposed to use the atMostEvery modifier of the flogger here:\n\n  logger.atWarning().atMostEvery(30, MINUTES).log(...)\n\nHowever, flogger semantics here is that really the call from *this line* is to be limited\nto every 30 MINUTES. This means that if we log for one plugin:\n\n  Restarting mandatory plugin foo not allowed\n\nAnd then immediately log the same for another plugin \"bar\", that log will be skipped.\n\nTherefore, the atMostEvery is not going to help us here.",
