      "message": "FWIW I think this was the only historical reason for the \"open repo\" naming: I wanted to emphasize that all repos should be opened eagerly early in the process.\n\nBut I completely agree with this change and your reasoning, there is no need to make this distinction in MergeOpRepoManager. I do like keeping the name openRepo for this particular method in MergeOp, but you\u0027ve done that, so that\u0027s great :)",
