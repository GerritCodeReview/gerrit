      "message": "Do we have a doc or other reference for \"project direction\"? I think I agree with what I think your intent is in this line, but I think Gerrit has only ever had a \"project direction\" in the vaguest sense, so perhaps this is overselling that idea some. I think I\u0027ve viewed it more as: \"* seem to be in scope for what Gerrit should do\" and that\u0027s been a subjective judgement for each maintainer.",

      "message": "Kinda along the lines of what David mentioned it in an earlier patchset, is it worth calling out the group of \"super supporters/contributors\" (for lack of a better name) that are not maintainers but do have extra perms for the mailing list, issue tracker and are typically in gerrit-verifiers? I actually don\u0027t know how many of us there are or if it\u0027s a group we\u0027d want to expand in the future, but think we\u0027ve historically had the view that any help folks want to give in those areas is a bonus to the project. Advertising the role more could help with that.",
