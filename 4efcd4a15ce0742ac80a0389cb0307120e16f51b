      "message": "I know it is already PS-22 but I have one more suggestion.\n\nYou tweak the refs in order to make sure the ref pattern check in validateForReceiveCommits will match this ref. So, a modified ref is used as a mean to pass the information to the validateForReceiveCommits that it should check for the change-id in the commit message. This looks like a workaround.\n\nMy proposal is to define new method(s) in CommitValidators: validateForEditCommit and validateForRevertCommit. Inside these methods you can simply use the ChangeIdValidator (along with other necessary validators) without performing any ref pattern check. All is clean, no need to tweak refs and method names clearly indicate in which context the validation is used.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "message": "Hi, Sasa \n\n Thanks for giving some light on this commit and provide new proposal!\n \n In fact the reason I tweak the refs is I find these refnames of \n ReceiveCommand  triggered from UI\u0027s revert and edit-commit-message\n are wrong, because I think no matter where the new patchset come \n from they should abide the same rule for new patchset: \n ReceiveCommits.NEW_PATCHSET.\n\n I think this is the root reason, so for keeping them to be consistent \n with those of new patchset pushed via ssh command I create the\n PS-22 . I think it is a reasonble and simple way to fix this issue and   \n abiding the same rule is easy to maintenance.\n\n will you please think it again? :) \n\n /Bruce",
