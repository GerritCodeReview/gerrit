      "message": "Shouldn\u0027t we preserve this option also for GET /changes/\u003cid\u003e/detail REST endpoint? Yes, change screen2 doesn\u0027t need this, but i think it makes sense, because you could pass in the following options:\n\n* CURRENT_COMMIT(3)\n* ALL_COMMITS(4)\n\nin which case commit info is returned as well. But because you have removed it here, there is no way for a caller to ask for it to be filled. So the only way would be to call in addition GET /changes/\u003cid\u003e/revision/\u003cnumber\u003e/commit?links endpoint.\n\nThis is considered to be a bad practice to require additional server roundtrip to get what you need.",
