      "message": "I tried to verify this change on german keyboard, on Linux (SuSE 42.1), on FF 44.0 and Chrome 49.0.2623.47. This diff hasn\u0027t fixed it here.\n\nI noticed, that the \u0027[\u0027, \u0027]\u0027 work as expected on german keyboard even without this change, when header on dif screen is in focus (I click with left mouse key inide header, and then hit \u0027[\u0027, \u0027]\u0027 keys; when next diff screen is opened, CM is again is already in focus and then \u0027[\u0027, \u0027]\u0027 not working again). Only when Codemirror is in focus, they don\u0027t work. So it seems, that Codemirror somehow copntributes to the problem. This shoud probably be mentioned in the commit message.",

      "message": "That\u0027s true. This diff doesn\u0027t fix the problem, when your focus is inside of CM. I also think, that CM contributes to this issue. But if your focus is outside of CM, this diff fix the problem. This diff also fix the navigation on the other pages, where \"[\", \"]\" are used.\n\nOn Linux, the shortcut \"[\", \"]\" already work, because the value for the attributes ctrlKey and altKey of KeyboardEvent (native JavaScript event) is false. But in OSX and Windows these attributes have the value \"true\".\n\nSo this fix only affects Windows and OSX.\n\nI was not able to debug CM, because the code of CM was obfuscated. I don\u0027t know how to force Buck to use a not obfuscated version of CM.",
