      "message": "With how it worked before this change.\n\nThe main reason for the security vulnerability after enabling attempt of Git v2 protocol was: ADVERTISE_REF hook was not called (erroneously by JGit) for Git v2 protocol, while we were relying that it is called.\n\nWith this series, we are migrating from ADVERTISE_REF hook to PERMISSION_AWARE_REF Database.\n\nPrevious change in this series added PERMISSION_AWARE_REF database.\n\nHowever, before this change both visibility constraint classes are active:\n\n* 1. ADVERTISE_REF hook\n* 2. PERMISSION_AWARE_REF database\n\nThis change is adding the setting to switch between the two, but doing it in backwards compatible way, meant ADVERTISE_REF is still enabled by default.\n\nShould I add this whole story to the commit message?",
