      "message": "I suggest preventing illegal character entry instead.  One way to do that which avoids having to black/whitelist characters which is error prone (note the string of fixes which Edwin has submitted to fix issues with this approach, more still lurk in Gerrit), is to use a class like this one: https://review.source.android.com/#/c/21771/1/gerrit-gwtui/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/client/ui/TextBoxBaseListener.java\n\nWhile that class is from a Change which has not been submitted yet, I think it would be OK to use it.  I could submit a Change with just that class if you would feel more comfortable using it that way?  The way to use that class is to simply override its onTextChange method to reset a textboxe\u0027s text to \"oldtext\" if the text does not validate (and is not blank).  You can then additionally use that to enable/disable a submit button accordingly.  See line 140 here for an example of that: https://review.source.android.com/#/c/21771/1/gerrit-gwtui/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/client/searches/SearchEditor.java",
