What is the usecase?\n\nAlso, you are using this in the context of a specific comment, so you already for example the file name. Would it make sense to pass the a parameter such that the plugin can opt-out early of providing suggestions for a specific type of file or comment range?",

Same problem in `generateSuggestEdit()`.\n\nYou could also make it so that the selector emits `undefined` until plugins are loaded and then `[]`.\n\nMaybe you even want to select the `providers` directly and not the `plugins`?\n\nIt would also be good to have a TODO (in the plugins model) for why you only use `[0]` of the `suggestionsPlugins`.",
