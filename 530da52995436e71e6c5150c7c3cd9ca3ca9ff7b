It would be better to adjust these styles and not add the div.\n\nMy main goal with flex+center was to vertically-center the label \u0026 vote/close icons without adding the assumption that the chip will always be used inline and have `--line-height-normal` height.\n\nIs it possible that the users of chip can control the chip height/max-height themselves? That way the current inline usage doesn\u0027t need to be baked into the chip.",

      "message": "Just wrapping all children in one \u003cdiv\u003e does indeed work against the idea of the flex layout, see my other comment.\n\nBut all direct children (flex-items) in a flex layout are forced to be display:block. If not, then the browser will force it upon the element, which is extremely confusing while debugging. That is why I think all three current flex-items should get a wrapper diff, because they are all supposed to be inline-something.\n\nI think it is easier for the \u003cgr-account-chip\u003e to assume exactly 22px height. The positioning within the chip is so tricky and fragile that I think we have to work with precise pixel height, if we want to keep this maintainable. Of course, if the need arises we could offer a `large` attribute or something, which would then force the chip to be exactly 28px height or something. But at the moment I think all usages are fine with strict 22px height of the chip.\n\nI think both `inline-flex` and `inline-block` can work for the `.container`.\n\nBut thinking about it the `inline-...` prefix does not make any sense to me. It should either be `flex` or `block`. There is no point opening an inline flow. Changing that reveals a problem in gr-message\u0027s css: It tells gr-account-chip to render display:inline, which is a bug: gr-account-chip must be either block or inline-block, but never inline.\n\nThe 22px height of the chip bothers me a lot btw, because it breaks the fundamental invariant of all lines being 20px high in Gerrit. But that is a different matter and has certainly nothing to do with this change. :-)",
