      "message": "\u003e Links are just entered into a DynamicSet, right? Why \n \u003e add a null link instead of just not adding the link?\n\nNot the web link itself is added to a DynamicSet, but a class that provides a web link depending on some input parameters (e.g. the project name). Depending on the parameters the provider may return a link or not.\n\n \u003e Even in this case, would it make sense to allow only \n \u003e _both_ name and URL either null or not null, disallowing \n \u003e one null/other not null?\n\nYou are right, after the web links have been refactored by [1] it doesn\u0027t make any sense to return null as name or URL, but the plugin can simply return null for the WebLinkInfo (instead of a WebLinkInfo that has null as URL). This should be fixed. Returning null as URL was needed as workaround for expressing \"no link\" before this refactoring was done.\n\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/60753",
