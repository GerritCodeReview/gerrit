      "message": "We cannot grant non-administrator users READ access on All-Projects. If we do this, every project would now inherit this READ access and they would become visible to every one.\n\nI know it\u0027s unlikely that someone creates a child project under a project he cannot see but I think to be consistent with the fact that user can have access(event be the owner) to a project without necessarily be able to see the parent, we should not block them to create projects under the same parent.\n\nA more likely use case when a user will create a project under a parent he cannot see is the following:\nCreating a project with no parent, Gerrit will automatically set All-Projects as its parent so from a user perspective, I get an error saying \"All-Projects not found\" even though I did not put anything in the create project form about All-Projects.\n\nI wanted to avoid doing special case about All-Project so that is why I proposed to skip parent visibility check for any project creation.",
