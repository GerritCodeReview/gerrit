      "message": "\u003e 1) Are we sure the same exception will be hit later?\n\nPretty sure, if this is a request for a change and that change cannot be parsed, I would be surprised if this request could be successful.\n\n\u003e 2) Can missing request info properties affect execution?\n\nIt\u0027s only used to turn on tracing via configuration and setting a logging tag. Just nice-to-have logic.\n\n\u003e Is it better to move createRequestInfo to inside the try-catch-block\n\u003e of service(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)?\n\nYes, but RequestInfo was also used in a catch block, where it would then not be available. But I think I found a way to avoid needing RequestInfo in the catch block, so that the creation of RequestInfo can be moved into the try-catch-block now. PTAL.",
