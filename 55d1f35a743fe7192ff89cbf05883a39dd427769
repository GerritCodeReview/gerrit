We should recheck on this in some weeks from now.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is already there, OK almost there: \"4.13-beta-1\". I can see, that another Google project: error prone already pointing to junit \"4.13-beta1\" in their build file: [1]. Given that Google has a monorepo and strict policy of providing \"one single version\" for each and every dependency this can be approved now, correct?\n\u003e \n\u003e [1] https://github.com/google/error-prone/blob/master/pom.xml#L40\n\nThey are now pointing to 4.13 [1]",
