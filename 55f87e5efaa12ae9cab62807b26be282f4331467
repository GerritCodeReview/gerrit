But it\u0027s a little hard to read the tests and verify that they are obviously correct; I am not good at doing these substring operations in my head.\n\nI think these tests could be a whole lot more readable if you could express them as:\n\n assertThat(intraline(a, b)).containsExactly(\n          common(\"start middle\"),\n          insert(\"middle\"),\n          common(\" end\\n\")\n     ).inOrder();\n\nDo you think that\u0027s feasible?",
