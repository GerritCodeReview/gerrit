      "message": "Is scalability a valid concern here? There aren\u0027t _that_ many fields in the change-metadata. If we\u0027re going with a relatively locked-down approach for plugins elsewhere, maybe it makes sense to do that here too.\n\nI guess what I\u0027m asking is for more detail in this section as to the pros and cons, but I think this is a great start.",

It\u0027s hard for me to make progress based on this.\n\n\u003e more detail\n\nThis design does not scale in my opinion, because at the moment this is a very narrow case.\nI expect more requests from plugin developers, both action-wise (styling, layout, etc) and location-wise (other places at change view, other views), and by providing overly specific interface will be restrictive in future.\n\nI think it\u0027s pretty obvious, but if needed, I can add this to the doc.",
