Would it be okay to squash them into one identity or must they stay seperate for legal reasons? E.g. Martin has 3 identities: Martin Fick \u003cmfick@codeaurora.org\u003e, Martin Fick \u003cmogulguy10@gmail.com\u003e, Martin Fick \u003cmogulguy@yahoo.com\u003e\n\nIf to squash them together which email address should win?",
