      "message": "My problem with this is we expose all project names to the browser.  An evil user could just install Firebug into their Firefox browser and easily view the list of projects he/she cannot see.\n\nFor an open source website like review.source.android.com, this is not a big deal.  However for a more private installation, leaking the name of known projects might leak the code name of an unannounced product or partnership, which can be a very big problem.\n\nSo we can\u0027t do this.  The only project names you can expose are the projects the user can currently see, and their parents, up to the --All Projects-- project.  So this logic needs to be rethought to ensure that the browser only sees that limited subset.",
