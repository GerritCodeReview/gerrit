Only when change/project is opened in change screen/project screen it should be loaded from the primary storage NoteDb/Git, but not on the change list/project list screens.\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/213333",

      "message": "I guess it would break anyway when the project permissions are checked. Evaluating the permissions implies the evaluation of the refs/meta/config/project.config and thus, if the repo isn\u0027t there anymore, we risk yet another NPE.\n\nHowever, I like your approach and will fix this NPE elsewhere when it will happen.",
