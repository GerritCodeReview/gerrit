      "message": "I wasn\u0027t sure what is the best place for this test. I put it temporarily in the wrong package, pgm, where similar integration tests are located (ReindexIT) that also inherited from StandaloneSiteTest class. But other tests are testing gerrit site-programs, while this test tests regular git communication and not a site-program. I see a number of options:\n\n* Move it to:\n\n  o javatests/c.g.g.acceptance/git or\n  o javatests/c.g.g.acceptance/git/protocols\n\n* Create a new package to emphasize the fundamentally new approach that we are taking here: start standalone gerrit server and connect to it with native Git client to perform the tests. So may be:\n\n  o javatests/c.g.g.acceptance/standalone\n  o javatests/c.g.g.standalone\n  o javatests/c.g.g.intergration\n\nWDYT?",
