      "message": "I am not sure the assumption of this test is correct.\n\nIf I understand correctly, in this test we are stating that the ETag calculation is based on the timestamp of the latest change reindex, thus, when a change is reindexed, we expect a new, different ETag for that change\u0027s actions.\n\nAs we discussed, this makes sense, because the actions associated with a change do not depend exclusively on the change itself, but also on the context that change is based on (parent chain, destination target, permission changes and so on).\n\nSo, I think it is misleading that change I4a3bd3147 summary is \"Include indexing status in ETag calculation\".\nFrom what I can tell, all it does is consider `lastUpdatedOn` in the ETag calculation, which is not an index property, as its definition suggests [1].\n\n`lastUpdatedOn` represents:\n\n```\nWhen was a meaningful modification last made to this record\u0027s data\n```\n\nand not, when the change was last indexed (which I don\u0027t think is a piece of data that exists at the moment in Gerrit).\n\nThoughts? @luca, @marcin?\n\n[1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/refs/heads/stable-2.16/java/com/google/gerrit/reviewdb/client/Change.java#453",
