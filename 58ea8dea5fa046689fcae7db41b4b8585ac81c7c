      "message": "This is incredibly confusing. You\u0027re in /gerrit/polygerrit-ui (since you\u0027re running ./run-server.sh directly), but the path you\u0027re passing to the -plugins flag (which should only have one -, not two --s) is relative to the /gerrit root directory.\n\nAlso, it\u0027s not necessary to pass specific paths (except that if you don\u0027t, no plugins are served at all...) if you\u0027re working on a plugin which is already enabled in the liver server config. If I have my /gerrit/plugins directory set up correctly (with plugins/pluginname/static/variousfiles.html in it), then I can just pass total nonsense to the -plugins flag and still have that plugin be served just fine, due to the undocumented \"automatically pick up ../plugins/\" behavior.",
