That\u0027d be a bit cleaner, more explicit, and testable.\n\nWe use the copy-clipboard element anywhere you see the copy icon, so hiding all of this related DOM in every scenario seems a bit inefficient.",

      "message": "I agree, but the label that gr-copy-clipboard can include (which is actually used in tandem with a few of those commands) makes the structure problematic.\n\nWhat do you suggest to do?\nI can check whether the label is only used with commands and if so, I will remove the support for it from gr-copy-clipboard and into the new gr-shell-command. Does that seem reasonable?\nHowever, if it is used without commands... I am not sure what to do. Suggestions?\n\nAlso, I did check for usage of gr-copy-clipboard and did not find a lot of usage (less than 10 if I remember correctly), which is why I was less worried about the enlargement.",
