I think this was written when \u0027message\u0027 was the only field in RevertInput, and should have been adapted when more field in RevertInput were added. Maybe we can fix that now. I would rephrase this whole paragraph to something like:\n\n\"The request body can include a link:#revert-input[RevertInput] entity to specify details for the revert.\"\n\nWhich fields exist and what are they default values don\u0027t need to be mentioned here as this is described by the RevertInput description.",
