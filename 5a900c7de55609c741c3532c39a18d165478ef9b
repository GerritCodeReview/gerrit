      "message": "Why are we no longer including the whole change ETag?\n\nFor efficiency you\u0027d probably also want to reuse the ProjectControl from this resource:\n\n ProjectControl ctl \u003d rsrc.getControl().getProjectControl();\n for (Change c : cs.changes()) {\n   new ChangeResource(ctl.controlFor(c)).prepareETag(h, user);\n }\n\nThis would imply storing a Collection\u003cChange\u003e in ChangeSet. But MergeSuperSet should be getting those for free from the secondary index, and I think the savings of not creating a bunch of new ChangeControls and ChangeDatas would be significant.",

      "message": "The time stamp ought be enough as it will be updated whenever other things change in the change?\n\nLooking at the history and the code of prepareETag, there is also inclusion of the row id and user id and notes.\nBut that would be covered by prepareETag of the current RevisionResource?\n\nAlso having a Collection of Changes in ChangeSet, which is an AutoValue storage class looks weird to me as a Change itself is mutable.",
