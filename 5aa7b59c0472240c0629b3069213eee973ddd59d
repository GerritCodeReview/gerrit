      "message": "Ah, looking at the docs, you\u0027re absolutetly right. But  the light weight branches are described however;\n\"To push lightweight (non annotated) tags, grant Push Branch +2 Create Branch for reference name refs/tags/*, as lightweight tags are implemented just like branches in Git.\"\nI have confused Push Branch +2 with the fictional Push Tag +3.. It was perhaps a little too late in the afternoon..\n\nAlso how to delete branches were described:\n\"To delete or overwrite an existing tag, grant Push Branch +3 Force Push Branch; Delete Branch for reference name refs/tags/*, as deleting a tag requires the same permission as deleting a branch.\"\n\nI\u0027ll submit a new change to correct this, and I also just realized that the new permissions should be linked in case you want to read more about a specific new permission.",
