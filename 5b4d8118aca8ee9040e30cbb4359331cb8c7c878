      "message": "Thanks. I was thinking about moving this and the follow-up change to stable-3.6 branch. As you know we can only bump Lucene version during major release, because only the previous lucene version codec is included in Lucene release.\n\nBut, we normally don\u0027t introduce any big changes after rc-3 was cut. @Luca, what do you mean?",

There is still a small chance that I need to make adjustments post-merge if problems come up when we deploy this change, but AFAICS now this looks good.\n\nThank you for your work on this, David and for the patience as we figured out the Lucene story at Google.",
