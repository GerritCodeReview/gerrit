Why it works/worked as expected in older gerrit releases?\n\nI believe the problem has been introduced between v2.14 and v2.15 when people started complaining on why the project list started being so slow.\n\nOn our production site, the success of the service has amplified the problem: what was \"bearable before\" it is crashing the JVM now :-(\n\nI tried this latest fix on our DR-site, the project list on GWT UX is rendered now within a couple of seconds, with negligible impact on the JVM heap.",
