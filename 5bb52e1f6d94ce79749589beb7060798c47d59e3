It\u0027s true that the 1.1 version is not contained in Maven central, but it is there in http://repo.spray.cc/, which is defined in the parent pom.xml as \u0027parboiled-repo\u0027. So Maven should be able to find the 1.1 artifact.\n\nAnyway I don\u0027t see anything wrong with upgrading :)\nJust wondering if the \u0027parboiled-repo\u0027 is then still needed? Probably it can be removed now?",
