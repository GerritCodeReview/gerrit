      "message": "I played around with the hovercard on my machine. I propose the following:\n* don\u0027t show the hovercard if users hover over a button (showing a hovercard while hovering on a button is not a UX pattern for hovercards)\n* The ideal behavior would be to always show the hovercard to the right of the vote or `No vote` text. I did not mention this aspect in the bug. What I meant was to display the hovercard to the right of the text (Vote, no vote) and not the cursor. Is such hovercard behavior possible?",
