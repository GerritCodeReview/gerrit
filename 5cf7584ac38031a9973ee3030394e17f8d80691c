The\n    example values shown above are the currently coded default ones.\n    \n    NOTE: the `replication_delay` property should be set to a value that is higher than the\n    `replication_delay` configured for the plugin, otherwise test scenarios using that property may\n    expect a completed replication too early and fail.",
