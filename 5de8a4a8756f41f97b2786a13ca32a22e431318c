This allows the delegation of access rights for certain branches or namespaces to other groups than the project owners. How would this delegation work if the push access right for refs/meta/config is required? If push on refs/meta/config is assigned the user can change the access rights for all branches/namespace but cannot be restricted to certain branches/namespaces anymore.",

Do you actually want to allow editing the project options (description, submit type etc), but not the project access rights? If yes, maybe better add a new permissions that allows to edit the project options without being project owner.",
