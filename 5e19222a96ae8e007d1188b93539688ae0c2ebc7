      "message": "On the surface, this already seems possible with alternate solutions (mount points, soft links...).  Can you put your actual use case here so that we can better understand the motivation?\n\nFrom other comments, you have posted the following reason: \"Yes, we use gerrit to create project and the main problem is that it does not know that it need to create a softlink.\"  I assume you mean to create the softlink and move the project to a different location than the basepath?  If so, then I don\u0027t see how this change solves that problem?  It seems to eliminate the need for the soft link, but it does not eliminate the more serious problem, that Gerrit did not create the project in the right place in the first place, which means that it is now race prone to move it (and to make the soft link)?\n\nI think I could use a better explanation of exactly what problem you are trying to solve (i.e. what you cannot already do today), and how this change solves it.",
