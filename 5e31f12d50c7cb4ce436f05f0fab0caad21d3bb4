Especially I\u0027m missing the horizontal line that seperates the meta data table from the current votes, as we have it on ChangeScreen2 at the moment. Have you tried putting a border around the meta data table?\n\nAlso there seems to be spacing missing between the current votes and the Related Changes. This might look better once Related Changes are displayed as tab [1].\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/50770",
