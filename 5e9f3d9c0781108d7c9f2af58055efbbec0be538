Instead you should be parsing say /etc/mime.types or taking the mime.types file that is shipped with the Apache HTTPd server and embedding it as a static resource in the Gerrit JAR.  Load that on server startup, creating a mapping of file extension to MIME type.  Then here name isn\u0027t relevant because we can pass in the contentType, which is guessed from the guessContentType method above by doing the lookup in the MIME type table.",
