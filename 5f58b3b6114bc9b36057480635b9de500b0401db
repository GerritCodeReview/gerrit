We would need to first change and release the frontend. And then later the backend. :-(\n\nEither we have break this up or delay the submit or the merge until I have at least forced the frontend to always return true for isAttentionSetEnabled(). What do you prefer?",

Also note, that this change is on stable-3.4 and the intention was to include it into 3.4 release.\n\nI am also working on removal of Assignee feature and will upload backend part of this change in a moment.",
