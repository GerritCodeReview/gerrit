      "message": "Looks good, thanks!\n\nBut on master we have two independent releases for frontend and backend. So we cannot merge this as is into master. We would need to first change and release the frontend. And then later the backend. :-(\n\nEither we have break this up or delay the submit or the merge until I have at least forced the frontend to always return true for isAttentionSetEnabled(). What do you prefer?",

Also note, that this change is on stable-3.4 and the intention was to include it into 3.4 release.\n\nI am also working on removal of Assignee feature and will upload backend part of this change in a moment.",

Then we are safe.\n\nDo we really gain much by including this into stable-3.4 at this point? Up to you, but there is a certain probability (like with everything else) that this is not working as intended, so you are introducing a certain risk to the 3.4 release.",
