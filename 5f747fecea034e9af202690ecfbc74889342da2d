      "message": "Unrelated note, more related to workflow issues: we talk about patch sets similar to the things you throw on mailing lists such as the git mailing list. In reality we do have changes/commits here, this may be one of the confusions I still have with gerrit. \n\nThe difference between a commit and a floating patch(set) is that there is an anchoring parent, which makes dealing with it more git-ish, but also more complicated for the review \u0026 integration process. (Why do I need to rebase it? Having all these different symbols indicating staleness for ancestors or other depending commits on top of the one I\u0027d be looking at)\n\nJust a random thought.",
