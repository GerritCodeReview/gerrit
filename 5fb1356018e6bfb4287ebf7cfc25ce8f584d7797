You are moving a lot of conditional logic that is easy to statically check references in from pure Java code into embedded script.  Its ugly.\n\nFor the other header fields in this change, I can see how the change makes the code easier to follow.  But this one just isn\u0027t working for me.",

      "message": "I can remove this and resubmit, no problem.\n\nOne thing to think about is that removing the checks actually makes things a bit simpler because velocity is \"smart\" enough to be able to do a.b() w/o having to check if a is null.  After all, the only thing we care about is whether there is a value or not, why force a distinction between null and blank?  This makes it operate a bit more like a scripting language.  For simple string formatting that is often an advantage and safer in the long run since it means that a missing null check cannot creep in very easily in the future.",
