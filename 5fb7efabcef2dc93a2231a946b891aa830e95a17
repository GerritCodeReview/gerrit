      "message": "Yeah, so it works somewhat, but it is still a bit weird:\n\n1. If FIRST_PARENT is your chosen default, then there is no URL for showing you the *latest* patchset against AUTO_MERGE. And for ...22038 the chose parent is FIRST_PARENT, but for ...222038/1 the chosen parent is AUTO_MERGE, which is very confusing.\n\n2. You cannot share URLs with other users and expect them to see the same thing.\n\nI think there is no way around somehow encoding AUTO_MERGE in the URL, *if* we want to support this feature.\n\nI would actually like to take a step back and discuss whether we need this feature at all. We have not had the feature for more than two years, and at Google nobody really complained about it. So I would like to remove the feature entirely and thus reduce the complexity of our system.\n\nWhy would users need a different default choice for which parent to see? What is the benefit?",

There is no URL for FIRST_PARENT against latest patch set, and I agree the URLs are a bit confusing, but this is already the case before my change.\n2. This is right, but only for the main change URL. If you share a file link, it always contains PS info.\n\nI see that there were reported bugs in the past when this feature broke in PG. See https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40008165 and https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40008170.\n\nI\u0027m in charge of merges in my project, and I care much more about the diff against first parent than the diff with auto-merge in the review process.\n\nSo when I click a change from the list, or from the review email, I don\u0027t want to choose Parent 1 every time. And when there are new comments and I reload the page, I also need to choose Parent 1. This is very annoying.",
