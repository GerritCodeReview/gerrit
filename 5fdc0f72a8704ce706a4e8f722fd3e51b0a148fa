(i.e. if a group is suggested exactly, it is visible to the user.)  In this case, it\u0027d be perfect for the needs--it wouldn\u0027t make sense for us to suggest something and then prohibit the user from adding--so, I\u0027m okay with this, but I\u0027d like to make sure this is the right direction, too.",
