      "message": "I know this was like this before, but I\u0027m wondering if it is really correct to use the account ID of the committer here.\n\nIf I understood the commit message correctly, this is about applying approvals that were specified on push. So I would expect that the approvals would be done in the name of the uploader and not in the name of the committer (which can be different in case you are allowed to forge the committer identity). I think it would be very wrong if I can add votes in the name of another user just because I\u0027m allowed to forge the committer on upload.\n\nAnd I believe that an uploader always must have an email address to be able to push successful.",

      "message": "Yes. I agree, it was always broken. Looking at PostReview code, the current user is used:\n\n c \u003d new PatchSetApproval(new PatchSetApproval.Key(\n                rsrc.getPatchSet().getId(),\n                rsrc.getAccountId(),\n                lt.getLabelId()),\n            ent.getValue(), TimeUtil.nowTs());\n\nso the fix would be to switch to using the uploader instead, like:\n\n  cells.add(new PatchSetApproval(new PatchSetApproval.Key(\n            ps.getId(),\n            ps.getUploader(),\n            lt.getLabelId()),\n            vote.getValue(),\n            ts));\n\nThis would solve both problems:\n\n* never ps.getUploader() null, as it\u0027s populated from currentUser.getAccountId()\n* uploader can not vote on behalf of another account\n\nright?",
