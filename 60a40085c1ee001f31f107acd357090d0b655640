      "message": "Trying to verify the mail-sending parts of this change, I think this is broken. If \u0027this\u0027 is instanceof AddReviewerSender, then it is also instanceof NewChangeSender (parent of AddReviewerSender). So the case of ADD_REVIEWER selected alone leads to not sending the email (removing the user below), as the above condition becomes true.\n\nI\u0027m not clear on what exactly is supposed to trig a NEW_CHANGE email here. If a user is not yet involved in a change, how can she expect emails, beside if she is watching the project -or being added as a reviewer?",
