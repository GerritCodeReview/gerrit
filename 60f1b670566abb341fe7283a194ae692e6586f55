My question is more about, those commits had the adding of new PluginModule() still before the createIndexModule() one, for WebAppInitializer (this class). -As opposed to Daemon, which adds the former after having added the latter (as expected). So, was that a problem (for WebAppInitializer) that we didn\u0027t catch while reviewing those original commits?",

I assumed that the revert swapped the order, but the original change that was reverted only added a comment on the current position of the PluginModule. And then I added OnlineUpgrade on wrong position and confused HttpPluginModule with PluginModule.\n\nI think something like this should be done on stable-2.15 branch and merged later to stable-2.16 and master: [1].\n\nAlternatively we could wait with merging this change, until that problem is fixed on stable-2.15 and amend this merge change again.\n\n* [1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/739945",
