Sorry for bringing this up so late in the review.\n\nAlso pinging @david.ostrovsky@gmail.com again, since it would be great to have a review from somebody that knows the OAuth implementation.

      "message": "This method now got huge and deals with multiple concerns. It might be nicer to have an extra link()-method that deals with linking a new ExternalId to an existing account and put the decision whether to create or link to the authenticate(AuthRequest who)-method. This would be cleaner and more extensible, e.g. if we want to be able to also link ExternalIds of other IDPs.",
