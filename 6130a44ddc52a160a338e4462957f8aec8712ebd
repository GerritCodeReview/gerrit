      "message": "I will definitely add a flag for the Hackathon work.\n\nOtherwise I think it depends on the individual change and how risky it is, and how difficult it is to use a flag.\n\nThis change does not make use of the model at all, so I don\u0027t anticipate issues and would prefer to not add a flag in this change.\n\nSwitching one property of one diff component to listen to the model instead of using a property could potentially be hard to flag protect, but maybe let\u0027s discuss that in those changes.",
