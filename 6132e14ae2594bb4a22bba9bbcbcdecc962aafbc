      "message": "I really liked Gustaf\u0027s idea to make special merge options register interest in a branch instead of adding code to this class for each special case (or maybe it just registers interest in all branches?).  So perhaps make something like a MergeListener Interface with several methods that MergeOp would call.  Here it would call  validateChange(), and below it could call a preMerge() method, likely it would also have a postMerge() method.  But since you don\u0027t need that last one yet, it could come later.  We just created a listener for that last method and will be pushing the idea up for review soon, maybe it will be something you could build upon.",
