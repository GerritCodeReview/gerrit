Then, it is clear where to create the empty commit:\n\n    o (branch-creation-request)\n   /\n  o A\n  |\n  o\n\nThe new branch would point to the commit A which is the parent of the branch-creation-request.\n\n\nOtherwise, if the Base: is specified in the commit message then the empty commit could be created on any commit.

So perhaps make something like a MergeListener Interface with several methods that MergeOp would call.  Here it would call  validateChange(), and below it could call a preMerge() method, likely it would also have a postMerge() method.  But since you don\u0027t need that last one yet, it could come later.  We just created a listener for that last method and will be pushing the idea up for review soon, maybe it will be something you could build upon.",
