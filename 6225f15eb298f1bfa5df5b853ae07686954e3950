A patch set is set of patches grouped together by a change id which is the same for all patches in that set.\n\nThis comment however makes it sound as if commit \u003d\u003d applied patch set?\n\nMaybe this is \n    \n    \u003cli\u003eIf an existing patch set of a change contains the commit ...\n\nis more intuitive?",
