      "message": "As mentioned in the Issue 16038 I did some investigation, and it seems that the problem was introduced in change 115151, with this check in AccountValidator, see the commit message\n\n```\n  However pushing updates to an account.config file is still rejected if:\n  [...]\n  - the own account is deactivated\n```\n\nIf I swap the order of conditions:\n\n  if (!newAccount.get().isActive() \u0026\u0026 accountId.equals(self.get().getAccountId())) {\n      messages.add(\"cannot deactivate own account\");\n    }\n\nthe code would work unless the account is indeed deactivated, during push to refs/users/* over HTTP.\n\nAs an alternative approach we could remove the check, see change 339668.\n\nGiven that change 115151 was included since 2.15 release, this regression wasn\u0027t detected for years.\n\nOptional: provide the above context in the commit message?",

      "message": "To fix the build dependency and to allow import of `WebSession` here, I tried two different approaches:\n\n* Move `WebSession` class to `com.google.gerrit.server?` package, see change 339669, but gave up, as it\u0027s too intrusive change and just feels totally wrong to me from the clear separation of concerns: `WebSession` actually belongs per definition to `c.g.g.httpd` package\n* Move GuiceRequestScopePropagator class to `com.google.gerrit.httpd` package, see change 339670, especially because the only caller of this class is WebModule, that itself already located in this package. This approach sounds right and looks promising.",
