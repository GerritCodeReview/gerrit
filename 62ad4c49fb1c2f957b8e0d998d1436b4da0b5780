      "message": "I think we should not be changing the default.\n\nThis change is probably most useful to have on 3.2 and 3.3. And for already released versions the default configs should not change in bugfix releases.\n\nFor master I am wondering whether we should maybe just try to remove the entire \"screen\" support right away. Is there much benefit in delaying the removal from 3.4 to 3.5?",
