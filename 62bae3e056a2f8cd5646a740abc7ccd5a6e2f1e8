      "message": "I think people would be furious if enter only completed and didn\u0027t search immediately in the search bar. My reference point is the Chrome omnibar and google.com. Tab-to-complete is actually not a thing generally in web UIs -- we\u0027ve had at least one discussion in our Hangouts chat about this very point. It\u0027s been supported in our search bar for a while now, though, so I\u0027d feel a bit weird about removing it.\n\nTo be fair, both the \u0027multi\u0027 and the \u0027tab-complete\u0027 properties exist right now only for the search bar, but I could foresee cases in which they would be useful separately.\n\nIf you think I should rethink this change, I\u0027d be down to, but as of right now this seems to make the most sense.",

      "message": "I vaguely remember the chat. I myself have really been missing tab-completion, and continually try to do it!\n\nI understand what you\u0027re saying in the case of our search bar where we have multi and tab-complete. I wonder if we should take into account tab complete *without* multi- perhaps that should work like enter? \n\nIn the case of multi * tabs, I\u0027m a little torn. I see your point about the search bar and feeling weird if they press enter and doesn\u0027t search, but just a counter-example is gmail and adding contacts- tabbing/entering on the autocomplete do the same thing. I do think that the expectation is different though, with the primary action being \"send\". I think this approach is ok for the time being.",
