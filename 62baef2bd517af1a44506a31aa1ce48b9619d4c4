      "message": "For healthy open source projects, I believe that expectations of being a maintainer (like other contributors) should only be about \"how to do things\" (quality, respectfully, with good judgement, following through...), not about what things the maintainer chooses to do, or how much time they spend doing those things. I would not want to scare away any new maintainers from accepting a maintainer role on the chance they believed that they could not dedicate a certain amount of time to the project. I also don\u0027t want to scare away any future contributions from any of the Gerrit maintainers that have, for all practical purposes, \"left\" the project. Some of them currently work at jobs that do not allow them to work on anything related to Gerrit. I would be delighted to see any contributions (including maintainer role stuff) from them at any time in the future. If they do things well, I value their contributions however big or little they are without expectations of more.\n\nReplacing the word \"expect\" with \"hope\" above would more closely reflect the vision that I mostly see in the community, and that I hope we can continue to follow in the future.",

      "message": "In a nutshell for this humble reply of mine, on this awesome thread overall: I\u0027d foster fairly explicit project activity to be a maintainer, in this very file and change -straight.\n\nHowever again in all fairness, I would also consider that it may take months or a few years for a no longer active maintainer to step down. It takes some non negligible energy to 1. nominate or 2. become a maintainer. So \"losing\" such an initial investment might be counter-productive or even sad, despite the ROI gained onward.\n\nI\u0027m also thinking of a potentially ever (or so) growing list of maintainers, which is likely not scaling in the longer run. A long list might taint the true meaning of the (active) maintainer role, or quite. -A living project has a footprint that matches that list. But this I think should not mean to prematurely step down if becoming (temporarily? who knows) inactive. And some still listed yet \"passive\" maintainers remain close enough to the project, given their lasting impact on it. Not sure I\u0027d personally foster their removal out of inactivity... unless another role can be used for that purpose.",

So far this was only an issue for Google, hence the current process doesn\u0027t foresee anyone else to veto. If this becomes an issue for other companies too, we should have a dedicated discussion about this on the mailing list. I don\u0027t think that the current library compliance process would scale well for this, and coming up with something better is probably not easy.\n\n\u003e What I have in mind too is the timely scoring of LC votes, which sometimes take a longer time\n\u003e given Googlers\u0027 genuine constraints on how much time they need to properly vote.\n\nYes, we are aware that this is a problem and we are working further on easing the pain here. E.g. Hanwen just made a change to remove the compliance label for upgrades of libraries which are not used at Google [1]. We have a daily rotation to look at changes which need library compliance, but if there is a version mismatch with what is used within Google, we need to upgrade all of Google to the new library version first, which is often not trivial. It\u0027s also a lot of work, which is why we are hesitant to do it if there is no obvious value in upgrading the library. We are happy to discuss the library upgrade process further, but I see this as unrelated to this change and our proposal for better project governance.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/221093",
