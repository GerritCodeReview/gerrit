      "message": "For healthy open source projects, I believe that expectations of being a maintainer (like other contributors) should only be about \"how to do things\" (quality, respectfully, with good judgement, following through...), not about what things the maintainer chooses to do, or how much time they spend doing those things. I would not want to scare away any new maintainers from accepting a maintainer role on the chance they believed that they could not dedicate a certain amount of time to the project. I also don\u0027t want to scare away any future contributions from any of the Gerrit maintainers that have, for all practical purposes, \"left\" the project. Some of them currently work at jobs that do not allow them to work on anything related to Gerrit. I would be delighted to see any contributions (including maintainer role stuff) from them at any time in the future. If they do things well, I value their contributions however big or little they are without expectations of more.\n\nReplacing the word \"expect\" with \"hope\" above would more closely reflect the vision that I mostly see in the community, and that I hope we can continue to follow in the future.",

IMM \"maintainers are expected to\" is not equivalent to \"currently all maintainers\". To me this statement means that the community expects this from a maintainer, and in my case (and I suspect many others) this is true. Expectations are not the same as outcome, it\u0027s something to strive for. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s in the interest of the community to communicate that it doesn\u0027t expect anything from it\u0027s maintainers.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e Disregarding my view on the outlined expectations I cannot even begin to understand how specifying these expectations could scare inactive maintainers into doing less.\n\u003e \u003e Having said that; the way I see it a maintainer is given the \"power\"\n\u003e \n\u003e More \"responsibility\" than \"power\" :-)\n\nTo me responsibility is not something you are given it is something you undertake, furthermore without power you cannot take on any responsibility. Even spiderman conceded that power comes before responsibility :-)\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e to veto changes, CR+2, do releases, etc. as they, apart for having the qualities you outlined, are deemed to have a good overview of the project from active participation and are therefore able to make these decisions based on a solid understanding of the effects.\n\u003e \n\u003e Not alone of course, but in agreement with the other maintainers and the rest of the community.\n\nThat\u0027s the responsibility part (what you should do), I\u0027m talking about the privileges (what you can do). As a maintainer you can veto changes and submit changes without asking other maintainers. It\u0027s up to each maintainer\u0027s own judgement if they feel that they should bring it up with other maintainers or not, there\u0027s nothing stopping them technically.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e If a maintainers work|life situation changed, so that he/she could no longer actively participate in the community, it wouldn\u0027t be unthinkable that they would even offer to \"step down\" from the maintainer role. There would be nothing keeping them from  participating in discussions, reviewing the odd code snippet etc. during their hiatus.\n\u003e \n\u003e This is not the current reality though. Look for instance recently Hugo (current maintainer) left Ericsson and now isn\u0027t using Gerrit for work anymore. He is still a maintainer even though he doesn\u0027t participate actively as before.\n\nI\u0027m not suggesting this is how it works today and not even that it should become a practice, I\u0027m merely saying that stepping down as a maintainer (if you choose to do so) does not mean that you cannot participate. I\u0027m saying maybe you are not best suited to act as a maintainer if you don\u0027t do anything Gerrit for a couple of years since you no longer as deep a knowledge of the project.\nAnd in Hugo\u0027s case (he is sorely missed), he has, for all intents and purposes, stepped down from being a maintainer since he is no longer active to any extent. Furthermore [my interpretation] I don\u0027t think he would be discouraged from taking up his engagement in the community in the future if this document states \"expects\" rather than \"hopes\". Also [also my interpretation] I suspect that he wouldn\u0027t start to act as a maintainer until he was up-to-speed again.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e If they have the chance to pick up their engagement in the community at a later date, they could continue as contrubuters, and if there was a need for more maintainers they could be reinstated.\n\u003e \n\u003e True, but let\u0027s discuss together face-to-face how to change the process: at the moment isn\u0027t in the way you described.\n\nI never claimed to be describing the current state, I am addressing expectations and the utility of having them.",
