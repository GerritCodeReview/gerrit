      "message": "For healthy open source projects, I believe that expectations of being a maintainer (like other contributors) should only be about \"how to do things\" (quality, respectfully, with good judgement, following through...), not about what things the maintainer chooses to do, or how much time they spend doing those things. I would not want to scare away any new maintainers from accepting a maintainer role on the chance they believed that they could not dedicate a certain amount of time to the project. I also don\u0027t want to scare away any future contributions from any of the Gerrit maintainers that have, for all practical purposes, \"left\" the project. Some of them currently work at jobs that do not allow them to work on anything related to Gerrit. I would be delighted to see any contributions (including maintainer role stuff) from them at any time in the future. If they do things well, I value their contributions however big or little they are without expectations of more.\n\nReplacing the word \"expect\" with \"hope\" above would more closely reflect the vision that I mostly see in the community, and that I hope we can continue to follow in the future.",

IMM \"maintainers are expected to\" is not equivalent to \"currently all maintainers\". To me this statement means that the community expects this from a maintainer, and in my case (and I suspect many others) this is true. Expectations are not the same as outcome, it\u0027s something to strive for.

      "message": "\u003e \u003e \u003e As a community member I *do* have the expectation on maintainers to dedicate *some* of their time to these tasks. I regard \"maintainer\" more as a Role with responsibilities than a badge of honor.\n\u003e \u003e \u003e I would even go so far as to say that it\u0027s a good thing for the community if nominated maintainers asks themselves \"do I have the time to take on this responsibility\", I know I would (if I for some odd reason got nominated).\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e I believe that this document describes how is the process *today* and not how we do think it should work, which is a different discussion we will have in 2 weeks\u0027 time.\n\u003e \u003e Personally, I share your point of view, but that is not the current reality.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e The reality is more the one Martin described: you if you to https://analytics.gerritforge.com and you do some query, you will realize that there are contributors (non-maintainers) that are doing way more work in terms of contribution and review than other maintainers.\n\u003e \n\u003e I believe we interpret we interpret this document differently. IMM \"maintainers are expected to\" is not equivalent to \"currently all maintainers\". To me this statement means that the community expects this from a maintainer, and in my case (and I suspect many others) this is true. Expectations are not the same as outcome, it\u0027s something to strive for. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s in the interest of the community to communicate that it doesn\u0027t expect anything from it\u0027s maintainers.\n\nWhen I asked Shawn back in Sep 2017 for his support to become a maintainer, he gave me this definition: \"A maintainer is a contributor with history of deep technical contributions across different parts of the core Gerrit codebase. Gerrit project has grown and changed a lot in the past 1-2 years, and it has become clear that, with a larger project, not every maintainer needs to be an expert on everything.\"\n\nHe did not mention the expectations you raised and, before the introduction of the https://analytics.gerrithub.io, I believe nobody really counted the contributions of maintainers.\n\nI believe we should stick for now to what was Shawn\u0027s definition of a maintainer and, once we have defined a new role and shared and agreed on an understanding of the responsibilities and expectations, we can ask the current maintainers if they are willing to take them on board and continue to be a maintainer of this project.\n\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e Disregarding my view on the outlined expectations I cannot even begin to understand how specifying these expectations could scare inactive maintainers into doing less.\n\u003e \u003e \u003e Having said that; the way I see it a maintainer is given the \"power\"\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e More \"responsibility\" than \"power\" :-)\n\u003e \n\u003e To me responsibility is not something you are given it is something you undertake, furthermore without power you cannot take on any responsibility.

      "message": "In a nutshell for this humble reply of mine, on this awesome thread overall: I\u0027d foster fairly explicit project activity to be a maintainer, in this very file and change -straight.\n\nHowever again in all fairness, I would also consider that it may take months or a few years for a no longer active maintainer to step down. It takes some non negligible energy to 1. nominate or 2. become a maintainer. So \"losing\" such an initial investment might be counter-productive or even sad, despite the ROI gained onward.\n\nI\u0027m also thinking of a potentially ever (or so) growing list of maintainers, which is likely not scaling in the longer run. A long list might taint the true meaning of the (active) maintainer role, or quite. -A living project has a footprint that matches that list. But this I think should not mean to prematurely step down if becoming (temporarily? who knows) inactive. And some still listed yet \"passive\" maintainers remain close enough to the project, given their lasting impact on it. Not sure I\u0027d personally foster their removal out of inactivity... unless another role can be used for that purpose.",
