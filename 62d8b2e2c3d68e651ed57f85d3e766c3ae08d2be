      "message": "I think supporting as many standards as possible is a worthy goal. Thinking ahead, I ask myself whether there may be some additional standards/formats that are required by yet other log parsers. This would then again require everybody scraping these logs to adapt their parser configuration. Would it make sense to make the timestamp format of logs configurable?\nI would suggest to provide some predefined templates (e.g. `ISO 8601` or `RFC3339`), one of which would be the default, and also free formats (e.g. `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`).\nThis of course comes with the downside of yet another configuration option (complexity) and non-standardized logs (sharing default parser configurations will be more difficult). I am thus pretty much undecided about this.",

      "message": "I personally don\u0027t see a high ROI in supporting any time-format.\n\nThe two (somewhat competing) internationally accepted time-formats today are ISO8601 (which obviously is the only standardized time-format) and RFC3339 (which is an adaptation of ISO8601 but isn\u0027t quite a sub-set thereof).\n\nBy having a time-format that\u0027s in the intersection of those two standards we effectively support both which should cover 99.99% of the cases. Any semi-modern framework supports at least one of the two standards.\nI don\u0027t quite see how this would be a problem.\n\nMy reasoning for uploading to stable-3.2 is that we still fulfill the promise of being ISO8601 compatible. If you feel that this is still too big of a change I\u0027ll be happy to move it to master.",
