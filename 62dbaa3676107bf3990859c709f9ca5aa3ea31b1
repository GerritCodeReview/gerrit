      "message": "While setting `val` to `null` does the trick, I think it\u0027s a bit too little.\nE.g.: it does not evict the cookie from the cache. It does not tell the\nclient to throw the cookie away.\n\nWhat about calling `logout` instead?\n\nThen all the invalidating would still happen in one place (the `logout` method) and intent is clear as well.",
