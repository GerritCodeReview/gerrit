      "message": "This is a technical solution to a social problem.\n\nI\u0027ve got developers who, rather than learn git, just want to mash keys and have it work. One of their \"mashing\" techniques seems to be \"git pull\" following by uploading the merge commit, then submitting it through gerrit. Which clutters history when the submit is successful, or confuses them when one of the ancestry path\u0027s contains commits unknown to gerrit.\n\nMerges aren\u0027t reviewable in gerrit right now anyway, so I\u0027d rather just prevent them from being uploaded in the first place.",
