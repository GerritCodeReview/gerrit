But please note that it was not my suggestion to preserve \"Edit Message\" button from the pre-change-edit workflow era and try to integrate it somehow in new change-edit-workflow.\n\nBefore this change the workflow for change commit message was:\n\n* 1. Click on \"Edit Message\" button, commit message appears in popup dialog, change, save \u003d\u003e Change edit is created \u003d\u003e \"Edit Message\" is hidden unless the Change edit is published or deleted, because to re-edit the commit message again, you supposed to click on edit icon in front of commit message row in file table to open popup dialog again.\n* 2. Create change edit by modifying another file. \"Edit Message\" is hidden on CS2. To modify commit message see A.1 above.\n\nWith this change the workflow for change commit message is:\n\n* 3. Click on \"Edit Message\" button, commit message appears in popup dialog, change, save \u003d\u003e Change edit is created \u003d\u003e \"Edit Message\" is hidden unless the Change edit is published or deleted, because to re-edit the commit message again, you supposed to click on commit message hyperlink to jump n edit screen (CM3 in edit mode)\n* 4. Create change edit by modifying another file. \"Edit Message\" is hidden on CS2. To modify commit message see 3 above.\n\nIOW this is not a problem that this change has introduced.
