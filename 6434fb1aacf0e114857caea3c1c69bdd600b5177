When first reading it, I thought it describes the type of the entities that are shown in the dashboard. So that a dashboard of dashboard type CHANGES would display changes and other types would display some other entities. I propose to name it \u0027Dashboard Kind\u0027.",

If this is the case, then we should probably document it here by a JavaDoc.\n\nAlso it looks like the first character of the dashboard type id should be unique, so that the types can be differentiated in the UI where only the first character is shown. This should maybe also be documented.\n\nAfter all, do we actually need to assign an explicit string as id? Wouldn\u0027t it be enough to use DashboardType.DEFAULT.name() as id? Then there wouldn\u0027t be a need for the asSet and fromId methods, but we could use DashboardType.values() and DashboardType.valueOf(id).",
