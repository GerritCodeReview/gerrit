      "message": "Sure. I tried, but it was rejected, because internally Google is using outdated version and is not able to upgrade, see [1]. Should we think about \"light fork gerrit\"? Other deps are affected as well, like Bouncy Castle security library, that is 3 major releases behind, see: [2].\n\nMy idea that we release two gerrit-3.2 versions one with Google approved deps, and another one with latest and greatest deps. See also Google Guice issue that prevents running gerrit on the latest JDK versions 13 and 14: [3],[4].\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/240699\n* [2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/241130\n* [3] https://groups.google.com/d/topic/repo-discuss/ZqEj7r9w_bY/discussion\n* [4] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/243014",

      "message": "Next week in Sunnyvale, there will be both JGit and Gerrit maintainers from inside and outside Google: this is a very valid point to raise.\n\nIf JGit isn\u0027t following Google rules about updating dependencies, does that mean that Google uses a private fork of JGit with its own validated deps?\n\nImagine that JGit upgrades Jetty to a major version that isn\u0027t compatible anymore with the outdated we have in Gerrit: how can we move forward? What Google does in that case?\n\nThere will be *plenty* of Google people in Sunnyvale on Monday, let\u0027s talk to them F2F :-)",
