My change had broken the Change log, where only the right side of the diff should be shown while the whole left side of the diff should be ignored.\n\nSimply adding `display:none` to .left doesn\u0027t work as it\u0027s not available in all rows - so we end up having some columns and yet available in different rows.\n\nThis CSS is already a fairly ugly workaround to hide columns \"on demand\" and should be completely refactored IMHO.",
