I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t have any special knowledge of how these exceptions occur since my involvement with this code starts with [1] where I migrated it from a `catch (Throwable e) {` to catching the specific exception types I could observe by interaction and by running tests. In this case, the exception originates in a test.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/88331/",
