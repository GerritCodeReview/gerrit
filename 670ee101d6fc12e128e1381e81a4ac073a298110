If the children ever did stateful stuff would this be an issue? Maybe consider a layer.clear() or layer.update() to go along with layer.annotate() so that the non-lit stuff is more compartmentalized and not leaking into lit-world.\n\nMaybe I am misunderstanding",

      "message": "Sorry. Added a longer commit message.\n\nI am not sure about the \"stateful\" stuff. I think a component like `gr-diff-text` must be prepared to be thrown away and to be re-construcuted from scratch. Currently I don\u0027t see an issue with that.\n\nDiff layers can be stateful. They can save references to elements, etc. They just have to make sure that another `annotate()` call updates such references. But that is now new behavior. It was existing behavior of layers before my changes that layers` `annotate()` methods could have been called multiple times.",

If it\u0027s not built into the system I would at least like this \"never add state here\" constraint to be captured in a jsdoc on `GrDiffText` class instead of just being \"something Ben knows\".",
