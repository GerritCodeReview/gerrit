If you f.i. attend a User Summit, you are both a User and a Supporter!\n\nFor me both User (perhaps \"Active User\") and Supporter would make for decent names for the merged role User+Supporter.\n\nThe differences between the other roles are that there are clear toll-gates:\n* You need to participate in some way to be considered a User/Supporter.\n* You need a CLA to become a contributor.\n* You need to be nominated and accepted by the other maintainers to become a Maintainer.",

IMO the hacking and contributing are quite central to the concept.\nIf I\u0027m not mistaken non-contributing hackathon participants have been tried before and that it was not a full-on success.\nPerhaps it\u0027s more honest to move this to the Contributor role.",
