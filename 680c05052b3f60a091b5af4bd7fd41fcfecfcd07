      "message": "The `changeId` is passed to the super-class which is the `AbstractChangeNotes`. If you want to understand to which change number it is associated, you have to keep that information unchanged.\n\nAlternatively, you could avoid passing the `virtualId` but then you would have to pass the virtualisation algorithm which I found more complicated to this one.\n\nIn both cases, you need to preserve the original change number (`changeId`).",
