      "message": "I\u0027m unsure what adding the copiedOver field in PatchSetApproval means for the serialization. I think it\u0027s not only that the field doesn\u0027t need to be serialized, but rather that the field shouldn\u0027t/mustn\u0027t be serialized. Normally this is ensured by making a field transient, but not sure if/how this can work with AutoValue classes. I would prefer if Patrick has a look at this before submitting. Other than that the change LGTM.",
