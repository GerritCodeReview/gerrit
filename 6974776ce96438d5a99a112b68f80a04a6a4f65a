      "message": "It\u0027s generic in the sense that it evaluates and processes the result of submit-like prolog rules that yield lists of submit records (which currently is the only thing we\u0027re using Prolog for). I can certainly rename the method to evaluateSubmitRules() and clarify the javadoc description.\n\nThe point of the commit is to be a clean and obviously correct refactoring of code that\u0027s currently hardcoded to evaluate a specific Prolog rule.\n\nRefactoring the code to be truly generic would be a much larger effort that would seem like a waste of time until we actually would have a use for it.",
