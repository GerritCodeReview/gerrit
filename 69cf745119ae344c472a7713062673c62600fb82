      "message": "if we reverted this change the first time it went in, we\u0027ll probably revert the second time too, so submitting as is won\u0027t yield progress.\n\nHow about having both code paths at the same time, and verifying that you get the same keys or the same values?\n\nOr use a gerrit config to switch which flavor to use, and so you can debug both code paths in real-time using a setting on canary.\n\nHow does the fetch/hit metric work for the getAll() end point? If you do getAll() for 1,000 accounts does that add 1000 lookup counts, or 1 count?",

To clarify: this change is a no/op in the open source project; it just replaces multiple cache get() with a single getAll() call.\n\nI reverted this change previously because in google3 we use different bindings for MemoryCacheFactory, which rely on different storage instead of h2 for persisted caches.

To clarify: this change is a no/op in the open source project; it just replaces multiple cache get() with a single getAll() call.\n\nIt being a no/op assumes no one is doing what Google is doing and using a different binding for the cache. I do think that\u0027s unlikely, but we shouldn\u0027t assume.\n\nThe code itself for switching to the getAll() looks fine though.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I reverted this change previously because in google3 we use different bindings for MemoryCacheFactory, which rely on different storage instead of h2 for persisted caches.
