We could easily replace Change.Status to extenstion.common.ChangStatus, check for example the change where Theme enum was moved from AccountDiffPreference recently. The reason you don\u0027t want to Change.Status enum to be moved to extension common is inly to hide internal mapping to chars:\n\n  public static final char STATUS_NEW \u003d \u0027n\u0027;\n  public static enum Status {\n    NEW(STATUS_NEW),\n    [...]\n\nWhereas ChangStatus is defined as:\n\n  public static enum ChangeStatus {\n    NEW,",

I pointed you to this commit: [1] in my previous comment: Theme was previously in \nAccountDiffPreference.java and stored in the database. I moved it in extension.common and added this class to extension GWT client module, so that it is exposed in both plugin API and in client extension GWT module that reviewdb depends on:\n\n  gwt_module(\n  name \u003d \u0027client\u0027,\n  srcs \u003d glob([\n    SRC + \u0027api/projects/ProjectState.java\u0027,\n    SRC + \u0027common/InheritableBoolean.java\u0027,\n    SRC + \u0027common/ListChangesOption.java\u0027,\n    SRC + \u0027common/SubmitType.java\u0027,\n    SRC + \u0027common/Theme.java\u0027,\n    SRC + \u0027webui/GerritTopMenu.java\u0027,\n  ]),\n  gwt_xml \u003d SRC + \u0027Extensions.gwt.xml\u0027,\n  visibility \u003d [\u0027PUBLIC\u0027],\n)\n\nWe could do exactly the same with Change.Status what i did with Theme.\n\n [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/61600",
