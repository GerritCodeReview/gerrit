We could easily replace Change.Status to extenstion.common.ChangStatus, check for example the change where Theme enum was moved from AccountDiffPreference recently. The reason you don\u0027t want to Change.Status enum to be moved to extension common is inly to hide internal mapping to chars:\n\n  public static final char STATUS_NEW \u003d \u0027n\u0027;\n  public static enum Status {\n    NEW(STATUS_NEW),\n    [...]\n\nWhereas ChangStatus is defined as:\n\n  public static enum ChangeStatus {\n    NEW,",
