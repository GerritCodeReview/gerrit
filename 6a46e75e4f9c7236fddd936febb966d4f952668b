      "message": "If you go to changes -\u003e open then click on a change and then set the attention on the owner and go back to the changes -\u003e open page. You’ll notice that the attention set isn’t set on the owner of the change even though you set it. this is because the model doesn’t know you have set it because the reload event wasn’t fired. We already do that for the reviewer/cc thing looking at the code. I’m open to creating a new event that doesn’t do all the things reload does but only gets the model to update the changes?",

      "message": "Ah, that is a specific user journey and more a matter of whether we generally want to reload the \"search result page\" when coming back to it. Again, I think there are pros and cons for doing so, but those need to be listed and discussed.\n\nAnd if we wanted to do something about it, then don\u0027t change the hovercard. Sending a generic \"reload\" event from a hovercard without knowing on which page the user is, seems like a bad idea. I would recommend removing that logic for the reviewer/cc case, as well.",
