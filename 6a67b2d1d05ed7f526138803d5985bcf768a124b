Did you verify manually that this works? Issue with `this` binding is described in your comment on my change [here](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/334339/1..3/polygerrit-ui/app/elements/change/gr-confirm-move-dialog/gr-confirm-move-dialog.ts#b115)\n\nGenerally I am worried that we call a bunch of private stuff in tests and a lot of the \"hook-together\" code is untested and error prone.",
