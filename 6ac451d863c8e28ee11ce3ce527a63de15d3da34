      "message": "This is controversial, as it stands. Looks on this change in the old change screen. Do you see disabled \"Restore\" button with a tooltip like: \"You cannot restore this button, because it is in status NEW. Only changes in status Abandoned could be restored.\" Would you expect such a button to be there in this specific case? Yes I agree, that in other cases, \"like submit a topic\", a maintainer would like to know why submit whole topic button is disabled, with tooltip: Not all changes are in submittable state. But the wording should be adjust to emphasized that this is use case specific.",
