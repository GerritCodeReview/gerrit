Do you see disabled \"Restore\" button with a tooltip like: \"You cannot restore this button, because it is in status NEW. Only changes in status Abandoned could be restored.\" Would you expect such a button to be there in this specific case? Yes I agree, that in other cases, \"like submit a topic\", a maintainer would like to know why submit whole topic button is disabled, with tooltip: Not all changes are in submittable state. But the wording should be adjust to emphasized that this is use case specific.",

      "message": "Only because we don\u0027t have any undo functionality doesn\u0027t mean we shouldn\u0027t strive to have it. This sentence describes a nice-to-have, not a must. You\u0027re right that implementing an undo functionality isn\u0027t trivial. Nevertheless, it\u0027s something which users appreciate a lot. They don\u0027t expect everything to be reversible to whichever state in the past. Sometimes being able to directly reverse the last action is sufficient.\n\nFor instance, imagine the deletion of a change edit. Directly after deletion, the commit object is still kept in the Git repository. Given the change ID, the ID of the base patch set and the SHA-1 of the commit, we could restore the change edit. The UI could remember them for a short period of time (say 10 seconds) and hence offer the undo functionality temporarily. I know that in reality we would have to consider harmful use but this should just be an example of what would be possible.",
