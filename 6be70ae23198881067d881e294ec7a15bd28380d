      "message": "If we don\u0027t add the submit category when cherry-picking, we never find the submitter here.  So submitter stays as null, which causes an NPE lower down.\n\nOne option I considered - this code is nearly identical to the private getSubmitter() method on line 1267, except getSubmitter() doesn\u0027t match up the patch set IDs, and it also doesn\u0027t call a.cache(c).  I\u0027d like to remove the duplication and just call getSubmitter() here, but I\u0027m not sure what the a.cache(c) call does.",

      "message": "I believe that approvals cache the state of a change in them (open/merged...).  I guess this is for dashboards: someone recently had a dashboard which claimed the change was merged, but it showed up in their dash in the middle section as if it were open, this was because the approval change status did not match what the change said, he filed an issue for it last week I think.  So, I suspect the a.cache(c) simply updates the change merged status in the approval, but I haven\u0027t looked at the code, I just thought it might help you figure it out to have that background info.\n\nAs for the patchset Id, note that 1279 searches by patchset, whereas 1339 grabs all the approvals for the entire change.",
