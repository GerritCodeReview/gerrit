      "message": "Thanks for asking. I think default visibility is fine here.\n\nDefault visibility means:\n\"Assignee, verifier and collaborators may edit. CCs can comment. Regular component-level permission settings apply.\"\n\nWe want newly filed security issues to be visible to the reporter (who is automatically added as a collaborator), as well as everyone how is directly added on the issue.\n\nBesides this only maintainers should be able to see security issues, which is what is configured by the regular component-level permissions.\n\nDoes this sound good to you?\n\nIf yes, we can make a quick test that this is working as intended. If you file an issue via this link, I can check that it\u0027s not visible to me when I remove my account from the maintainers group.",
