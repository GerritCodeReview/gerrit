However this field doesn\u0027t seem to be documented, so I wonder how important it is. I think it is needed to debug Prolog rules that cause too many reductions (see [1]).\n\nAt least it should be explained in the commit message why we think it\u0027s safe to remove this field.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/58213",
