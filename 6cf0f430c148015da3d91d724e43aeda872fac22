      "message": "\u003e Could you provide a bit more details with what you meam. Which part is too broad?\n\nParticularly the jump from \"owners can edit\" to \"anyone with EDIT_CUSTOM_KEYED_VALUES can edit\", but also perhaps even the \"owners can edit\" part, depending on the exact use case. For example, imagine if there was some kind of custom key representing a legal hold on a change. In that case, maybe you wouldn\u0027t want owners to be able to add or remove it, but only a specific group of users or a bot.\n\nIf it\u0027s not a use case you expect for these keyed values then I don\u0027t think you have to solve it in this change. Maybe it becomes a parallel concept in a \"namespaced keyed values\" storage or something like that where you can enforce access controls in a different way (perhaps more like how access for labels is managed).",
