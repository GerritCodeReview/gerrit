ChangeDataLoaded -\u003e the time that all data fetching behavior happens within the _reload ? should not this starts from the top of the _reload method (it currently starts right before the Promise.all, not a huge deal as most of actions are async in between, but definitely good for readability) ?\n2. ChangeReloaded -\u003e only measures the time of fetching changeDetail ? so getProjectConfig, reloadComments, etc are excluded",
