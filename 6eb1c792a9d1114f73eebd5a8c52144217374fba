      "message": "This is a good reason not to use that Difference menu.\n\nI think we should keep ChangeScreen2/SideBySide2 UI simple. I have always found wedging these huge panels into the top of a screen offensive, SideBySide2 is a nice way to get away from them. Martin will probably just ask for them back.\n\nIf you want the files, go up to the change screen and the file list. We already do this with \"u\" keystoke and the up arrow in the top right.\n\nIf you want the commit message, go to the commit message. Again up to the change screen and either the header or the Commit Message file entry.\n\nThe diff preferences have no place to go. I think we should put them as a floating panel on top of the CM3 instances, rather than a fixed object in the page. My ideal position would be on top of the A (left side) CM3 about 50px down from its top and be more tall than wide so it doesn\u0027t overlap onto the B (right side) CM3. Why? Most code reviews are looking at the B side and want to adjust a preference to help them read it better.",
