      "message": "I\u0027m surprised to find this at `config:review`, since it looks like a variant of `POST /projects/{project-name}/access` and the different name makes it less discoverable. Would it work for this to *be* `POST /projects/{project-name}/access`, just with some field in ProjectAccessInput to indicate that it is for review instead of for immediate application?",

      "message": "There are three ways to handle that:\n\nA. return ProjectAccessInfo, like today. Add any relevant extra values as new fields to that class. E.g. add a \u0027ChangeInfo change;\u0027 field to ProjectAccessInfo and only set it in the for-review case.\n\nB. return Object and pick the actual return type based on arguments.\n\nC. name the endpoint /projects/{project-name}/access:review\n\nB is ugly so I wouldn\u0027t encourage doing it. A or C seems fine. I think I prefer A over C, but it\u0027s not a strong preference. What was particularly confusing to me was that this was called config:review instead of access:review.",
