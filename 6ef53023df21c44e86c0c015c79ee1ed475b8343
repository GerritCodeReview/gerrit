Let\u0027s get Martin to test it maybe?\n\nIf it\u0027s an issue we can probably do this in a batch during reindexing. It might even make sense to factor out a getBatch(Iterable\u003cChangeData\u003e, FillArgs) for this kind of thing more generally, but I\u0027ll take care of that if/when it happens.",
