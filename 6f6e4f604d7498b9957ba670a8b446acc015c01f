      "message": "As the name says Registered-Users are the users that have registered at Gerrit (aka created a Gerrit account). Semantically it seems wrong to include external users (users who didn\u0027t register) into that group. It would be quite confusing for everyone if Registered-Users can contain non-registered users. Can we avoid this confusion somehow? E.g. should we have another group for this, or should the group be renamed first?",
