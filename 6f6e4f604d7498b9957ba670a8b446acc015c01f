      "message": "As the name says Registered-Users are the users that have registered at Gerrit (aka created a Gerrit account). Semantically it seems wrong to include external users (users who didn\u0027t register) into that group. It would be quite confusing for everyone if Registered-Users can contain non-registered users. Can we avoid this confusion somehow? E.g. should we have another group for this, or should the group be renamed first?",

      "message": "I would argue the other way: These are registered users (users that we have account details for). They don\u0027t have an internal Gerrit account, but they are still registered (e.g. in FooCorporation\u0027s LDAP). So there\u0027s a difference between them and anonymous users.\n\nWe could create a separate group, but if we want to move towards having different account backends, I think it would be wise not to do that so that irrespective of the account or authentication backend you use, you have some base assumptions that are correct.\n\nWe could rename to something like \"KNOWN_USERS\" but IMO the cost (migration) out-weights the benefit (naming nit).\n\nWDYT?",

So I\u0027m fine with proceeding with this change. Renaming this group to \"Known Users\" would make this much clearer in my opinion, but I see how this migration is a lot of work...\n\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/access-control.html#registered_users",
