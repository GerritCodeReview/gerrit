      "message": "just suggestions, I feel like this should not be done in the thread component, and it should be done in comment itself. Maybe just pass the `thread` down to every comment.\n\nThe benefit is when you need to check for new conditions, you don\u0027t need to add a new property and have to pass it down from thread to comment. As comment will have the thread info, comment can determine all by itself. And the code should be much easier to read and understand (self-encapsulated logic)",
