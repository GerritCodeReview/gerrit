      "message": "I realized this weekend that we are inconsistent in using strings for label values in some places (\"-1\", \"0\", \"+1\") and numbers in others. I would be in favor of using numbers everywhere, except for this pesky field, which is an object and thus only has string keys.\n\nPart of me wants to say hey, it\u0027s JS, there\u0027s automatic conversion, we can just convert these string keys back to numbers and then format them with +/- on the client side. And things like indexing permitted_labels into this object, which I want to work, still would.\n\nThe other part of me says if we\u0027re using strings, they should be properly-formatted strings and we shouldn\u0027t need to convert them back to numbers.\n\nRegardless, we need to settle on something before this documentation lands :)\n\nThoughts?",

      "message": "Good point.\n\nNot sure if I have a final opinion about this, but I can share some of my thoughts about this.\n\nIf we have different fields with the same semantic, I think these fields should have the same type. So if we have label values in different places, it would be good to have them everywhere with the same type.\n\nIf I could choose between int and string for the label values, I would also go for ints.\n\nAs you\u0027ve pointed out, we cannot use int as keys for the \u0027values\u0027 map above. Maybe instead of the map we could have a list of ValueInfo entities, that have two fields: \u0027value\u0027 as int and \u0027description\u0027 as string? Would this solve the problem?\n\nIf we go for strings, I would probably prefer to do the formatting on client side as there can be different clients that would have different ideas about how the formatting should be done.",

      "message": "Yes, I considered making the \"values\" field a list of objects as you suggest. It just seems so verbose. (Though elsewhere I\u0027ve called the description \"text\", which is a tiny bit less verbose I suppose.)\n\nI think I agree now that formatting should be done on the client side in any case.",

Naming the field that contains the description \u0027text\u0027 sounds fine to me.\n\nActually I think there is no need to wait with the documentation until everything is ready and all details are clarified.
