      "message": "Answering my question from my comment in the dev-plugins.txt, this looks like the listener\nhas to put the thread to sleep if it wants to delay the task? This can potentially waste\nthe threads I think.\n\nExample assume we have one thread free and two tasks in the queue: lightweight-task and heavyweight-task. The heavyweight-task is run first and the listener decides that due to\nthe currently high load the heavyweight-task needs to be delayed. The thread sleeps.\nHowever, this thread could have been used to run the lightweight-task instead of putting\nit to sleep.\n\nMaybe, instead of using just a listener here we need something with richer semantics.\nSomething that gives or rejects a permission for the task to be run, like a semaphore?\nOf course, this would require a more intrusive change here as we would need to consider\nthe return value from the listener.",
