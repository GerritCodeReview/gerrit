      "message": "I thought we agreed to use a bit more sophisticated logic on the frontend. Only if there\u0027s a newer patchset and only if the comment is not on base/parent, Gerrit would point the user to the diff against the latest patchset. The frontend seems to automatically send diff requests for patchset X against patchset X to a diff of patchset X against base, so that case might still work (at least at the moment as long as we have the frontend magic). The links for comments on base/parents would point users to pages on which they can\u0027t see the comments, though.\n\nIn general, I think we are missing the actual intention of this change. When people add comments, they typically do so on the latest patchset. Gerrit generates and sends the emails at that point in time and hence can\u0027t include links to diffs against patchsets which will be uploaded later. Those diffs are the ones users would want to see, though.",

      "message": "On the frontend side yes, if comment is on Base/Latest then the user will see Base vs X which is the current behaviour.\nHowever if it\u0027s on any other patchset X, they see X vs Latest and a toast to go to Base vs X via keyboard shortcuts.\n\nIf user commented on Base on patchset X, then the email will take the users to the diff of Base vs Patchset X right?\nSo the user should be able to see the comment on the left side.\nWe can take them after that via a toast to Base vs Latest, but users won\u0027t be able to see the comment then, so not sure if that makes a lot of sense. \n\nWe don\u0027t really need to diff against future patchsets in the emails for now(although it would be a really nice to have feature). It\u0027s probably not even possible to know since the latest patchset will be created in the future.",
