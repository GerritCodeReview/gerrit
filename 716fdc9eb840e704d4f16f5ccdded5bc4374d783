      "message": "The former.\nIt is a defect of AllRequestsFilters\u0027 FilterProxy.\n\nBut I am not sure what you mean by \"more specific\".\nThe issue is that \"FilterProxy did not keep\ntrack of which filters have been around when its own init\ngot called.\" From my point of view, it does not get more\nspecific than that. And that sentence is already part\nof the commit message.\n\nWhat phrasing should I add?",
