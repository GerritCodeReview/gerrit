      "message": "This is a little confusing to me, in part perhaps because gerrit\u0027s concept of a patch set is confusing. E.g. when I first read this, it made me think that a change is a topic grouping a collection of commits under review.\n\nA change represents a single commit under review. It can have one or more patch sets, representing attempts to produce a better commit which the author produced over time. The change owner can create a new patch set by amending the commit (with \"git commit --amend\") and pushing again to refs/for/master for review.",

      "message": "I have another topic coming up that focuses specifically on patch sets. I was considering putting the two topics together, but thought this topic could move forward independently.\n\nIn the User guide, under the changes section, there\u0027s a paragraph that states: \n\n\"A change consists of a Change-Id, meta data (owner, project, target branch etc.), one or more patch sets, comments and votes. A patch set is a git commit. Each patch set in a change represents a new version of the change and replaces the previous patch set.\"\n\nLines 3 and 4, and the list that follows, was my attempt to rewrite this paragraph. It was the phrase \"consists of...one or more patch sets...\" and the sentence \"A patch set is a git commit\" that prompted me to state that a change is a group of related patch sets.\n\nPerhaps we should say \"commits\" instead of patch sets? Or I could add the Patch Set topic to this change and link to it?",

      "message": "\"Each patch set in a change represents a new version of the change and replaces the previous patch set.\" --- that\u0027s the text that makes it less confusing for me.\n\nPerhaps the first sentence would say something like \"A change represents a single commit under review\". Then afterwards it could talk about how there can be multiple revisions of a change (Gerrit jargon talks about \"revisions\" and \"patch sets\" interchangeably --- if you have ideas for clearing up that terminology then that would be wonderful) and that each revision represents a new version and replaces the previous one.",
