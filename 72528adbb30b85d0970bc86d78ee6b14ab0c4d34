Really all that\u0027s changed is I added ..\n\n (function() {\n\n.. to the beginning, and ..\n\n   window.GrLinkTextParser \u003d GrLinkTextParser;\n })();\n\n.. and indented everything in-between. It gets confused on ..\n\n  var fragment \u003d document.createDocumentFragment();\n\n.. because that line appears twice at different levels of indentation.",
