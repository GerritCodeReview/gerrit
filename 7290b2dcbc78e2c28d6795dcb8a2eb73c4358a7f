      "message": "As commented on previous changes, creating the auto-merge commit should happen outside of the new diff caches. So, this method should hopefully go away.\n\nHandling auto-merges properly might be worth a change on its own. In order to use the new caches as quickly as possible for REST endpoints, I\u0027d suggest that you split the calls before the Diffs facade. For instance, you could delegate to the Diffs facade (and hence use the new diff caches) for most calls but still go to the old diff caches for auto-merge requests. As soon as you have the auto-merge handling in place in the Diffs facade, you can remove the temporary split.",

      "message": "This class is used as cache key by existing caches. Changing it could mean that we involuntarily flush existing caches. In addition, PatchListEntry has custom methods for serialization and deserialization, which we use for the old caches. That\u0027s the reason PatchListEntry wasn\u0027t annotated as Serializable in the past.\n\nAs commented on previous changes, we shouldn\u0027t use PatchListEntry for the new caches. Hence, this adjustment (and the one in line 69-77) should become unnecessary.",
