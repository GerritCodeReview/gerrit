      "message": "I want to show ancestors that are dependent on future patch sets of the revision.\n\nSay you start with this: C2 -\u003e C1\n\nThen you add another commit such that: C3 -\u003e C2\u0027 -\u003e C1\u0027\n\nWhen you are viewing C2, Related changes returns:\n\n C3\n C2\n C1\n\nEven though there is no link from C3 -\u003e C2.\n\nMy main motivation for this is when navigating changes via J/K/O.  I want to know if the patchset I am currently on (C2) will show up when I navigate to C3.  The \u0027~\u0027 tells me that this is not actually an ancestor so the current patch set I am viewing will not show up when I navigate there.  In my simple example it doesn\u0027t really matter, but if C2\u0027 is vastly different from C2 and has a different related changes listing, the jump can be jarring.",
