      "message": "i think it would be helpful to add Say-hello UiAction in helloworld-plugin, and show a popup dialog with language selection (french | english) and say hello in alert in the language, that user has selected. And mention this show case here or in the line 274. Something like that, but stripped the Capability (or even let it there?) and extend with JS RPC machinery:\n\n https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/48206\n\nI didn\u0027t implement it because i guess it is not going to be merged? In this case we should point here or on the line 274 to the very informative commit message of this change as a show case:\n\n https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/47870",

      "message": "I was also thinking that the HelloWorld plugin should be updated to demonstrate more of the features of the plugin API.  This is one case, the others I was thinking about are the commit validation and merge validation.\n\nThere\u0027s a sample plugin for commit validation but I think it would be better to deprecate that and move that functionality into HelloWorld.\n\nOr actually, \"Hello World\" is not really a good name.  Maybe create a new plugin for this.\n\nAs for examples of the JS API, I deliberately didn\u0027t include anything here because I thought the documentation in js-api.txt was enough.\n\nIf you think it needs to be more detailed, I would prefer to expand that documentation rather than putting it in the release note.",

      "message": "+1 for new plugin name, and deprecating \"plugin for commit validation\".\n\nWe should call the new plugin cookbook-plugin or something like that and put show cases for everything that \"plugin API\" already supports ant even what is not yet supported.\n\nI already suggested somewhere to introduce this plugin show case concept, but Shawn rejected the idea with:\n\n\"I am not going to maintain that mess\"\n\nAs for examples of the JS API: check that commit message:\n\n https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/47870\n\nNobody is aware this commit message even exists and because the topic is rather complex, and involves a lot Java, JS and plugin integration concepts, we meed a working show case here.",
