You don\u0027t need to abandon it, as you can use the \"Move change\" function inside the drop down menu at the top right of this page and select \u0027stable-3.6\u0027 as the new branch. Then you\u0027ll want to click the Rebase button and resolve any conflicts.\n\nLet me know if you need help with any of that.\n\nNasser",
