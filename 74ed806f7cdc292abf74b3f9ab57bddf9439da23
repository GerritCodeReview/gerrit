      "message": "That\u0027s great idea. While it would make sense to toggle hideA()/showA() for files that were changed, for new files, we could safely hide left side hard coded, right?\n\nMoreover i am very interesting to (ab-)use \"hideA()\" feature for inline-edit series. The idea is to provide edit possibility in full screen mode in CodeMirror instance. Do you have a hint for me how to do that?",

      "message": "Yes we could default to hideA for new files. I think that is better done by another commit. I also think if that should be a preference. Some users like myself tend to read the right side when reviewing many files. Jumping to the left on an add because hideA is enabled means I have to stop focusing on the right side and move my gaze to the left, then maybe back right for the next file.\n\nIf the edit series is built on sbs2 code you just need to use the setVisibleA(false) method to enable hideA.",
