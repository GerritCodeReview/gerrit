While it would make sense to toggle hideA()/showA() for files that were changed, for new files, we could safely hide left side hard coded, right?\n\nMoreover i am very interesting to (ab-)use \"hideA()\" feature for inline-edit series. The idea is to provide edit possibility in full screen mode in CodeMirror instance. Do you have a hint for me how to do that?",
