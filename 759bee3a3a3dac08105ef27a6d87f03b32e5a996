      "message": "I think that perhaps you could avoid the  repo !\u003d null checks by scoping your trys a bit differently (you may need a third one).  Typically the way I see Shawn doing this with repos is that he will open the repo (like line 192), and then open a try with a finally that closes the repo after the original open.  In your case, it might make some of the scopes of the trys and the catches a bit more obvious.?  If you don\u0027t think so, ignore my comment. :)",
