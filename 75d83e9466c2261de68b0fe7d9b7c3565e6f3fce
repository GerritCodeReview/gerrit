      "message": "Aha, now I understand why I didn\u0027t find delete project in the documentation ;-)\n\nDouble maintaining this in the core documentation doesn\u0027t make sense hence I will abandon this change.\n\nI was looking for the documentation of delete project and couldn\u0027t find it, didn\u0027t come to the idea that this is functionality contributed by a core plugin. As a maintainer I should have known.\n\nMaybe we could consider to integrate documentation of plugins into the main documentation during the build for plugins which are listed in `tools/bzl/plugins.bzl`. I think that would improve discoverability of their features.\n\nWDYT ?",
