      "message": "I think this feature needs to be seriously rethought.  The list of potential receivers of these emails is huge.  I could see why owners might (but I am not convinced that they will always) want this info, and since owners are always specified by groups, this could easily be much larger than expected.  Unlike change owners, I do not think that it is reasonable to send email to project owners without giving them an option to decline.  Without introducing a new category to watch projects by, I am also not convinced that all project watchers want this info.  I suspect that we are not alone in having some branches which we push external contributions too all the time (in our case, hourly); the amount \nof undesired email that this would generate if I understand this correctly is enormous.",

      "message": "Hi, Martin. Thanks for your thorough idea first. Should I understand your meaning like following: You would like to send this kind of notification email to the person who has explicitly tell Gerrit he/she want to this kind of email, but not send this mail to all the owners of the project. Or else, this feature will send a lot of junk mails. Am I right?\nSo, I am thinking of just send this notification mail only to the watcher, not to the project owner. If some owner want to receive this kind of notification mail, he/she also have to watch this certain project and this certain branch(es). I mean that watching this project (with branches) means subscribing the mail, only the subscriber will be notified. Do you think I am right?",
