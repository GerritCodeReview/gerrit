      "message": "Is this accurate? I would have expected this statement to be:\n\n  Allow Gerrit v3.2 to start even if the underlying schema version\n  has not been bumped yet, and is still 181 (corresponds to the v3.1)\n\nThe only problem still remains here is: If someone would jump over the releases. Say we add this experimental option in v3.2 and someone would set it to true, and has gerri site with v3.2 installed and will start the site upgrade to v3.4, jumping over v3.3 without making a stop there. In that case the NoteDb Schem Version check would still accept it, right. That is of course wrong, because online reindex could be unsupported?",
