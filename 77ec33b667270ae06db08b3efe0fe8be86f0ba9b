      "message": "Actually, JGit already has a QuotedString class that might work better than rebuilding this logic.\n\nI\u0027m also wondering if we shouldn\u0027t use an approach like git for-each-ref does where you can ask for output in sh format. That is if the output is a simple split using \\t as a delimiter (for example) that you can read in shell with IFS\u003d\"\\t\" then we could instead output in a sh readable format by eval, e.g. the caller could do:\n\n  while read line; do\n    eval \"$line\"\n    echo $col_name; echo $col_uuid;\n  done \u003c(ssh gerrit ls-groups --sh)\n\nand each line out output is like:\n\n  col_name\u003d\"blah\";col_uuid\u003d\"1223\";\n  col_name\u003d\"other\";col_uuid\u003d\"98182\";\n\nJSON isn\u0027t easy to work with in shell. But shell that you can safely eval to get variables set is. And so is a string that is safely split with an IFS setting so long as the delimiter can never appear in any of the column values.",
