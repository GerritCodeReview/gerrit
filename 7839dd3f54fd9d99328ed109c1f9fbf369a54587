We have to treat \"refs/publish/*\" as a synonym of\n    \"refs/for/*\" for now. To make this branch unmagical, we could follow\n    the following steps:\n    1- [This Change] Treat \"refs/publish/*\" like \"refs/for/*\" but output\n    a warning.\n    2- Remove dependencies on this magic branch.\n    3- Converting the warning to an error.\n    4- Stop treating it magical.\n    \n\nthere is a change for git-review on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/584607/\n\nIMO, we should just have a deprecation policy that things live deprecated for one release and then remove it. I think we shouldn\u0027t be on the hook for other tools that we don\u0027t really support.",
