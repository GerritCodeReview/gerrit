The only case where this may break I think is if the error code can only be reliably provided through err.getNextException()\u0027s own code, or recursively through one of err.iterator()\u0027s.\n\nTesting this change would likely tell us that. I cannot test it myself either right now. But otherwise, the above fix can only help improve the situation anyway I think.",
