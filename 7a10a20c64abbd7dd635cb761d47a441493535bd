This applies to both\nVelocity and Commons. We also don\u0027t minimize Velocity for similar reasons.\"\n\n\nThat means that we can potentially have commons and velocity twice on the classpath. Standalone and from auto-value. And those versions can diverge, obviously.\n\n* [1] https://github.com/google/auto/blob/master/value/pom.xml",
