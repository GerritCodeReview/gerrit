In the new process it\u0027s the responsibility of the reviewer that proposes an alternative solution, to describe it in a solution.md file and upload it for review. So that burden is at least partly taken away from the design doc author.\n\nI\u0027ve changed the phrasing to make this more clear.\n\nYour 2 points are still valid though. I think we should add them as part of the best practices for design doc reviews that we intend to add as follow-up change.",

If we find good criteria for this, I\u0027m happy to add them to the docs.\n\n\u003e I.e. when should you still make a comment on the other proposed solution vs. start a new doc\n\nWhat I expect to happen is that first a comment is made, then the idea is discussed a bit and then the author either includes it or asks the proposer to start a new solution doc. Not sure if I should add it like this to the docs?\n\n\u003e Should we allow solutions to reference other solutions? For example:\n\u003e Solution 1 is a primary storage rewrite + cache design rewrite\n\u003e Solution 2 is the same as 1 but the cache design is different?\n\nYes, this should be allowed. I added a sentence to the solution template to make this clear. Let me know if you think this should be highlighted more.",
