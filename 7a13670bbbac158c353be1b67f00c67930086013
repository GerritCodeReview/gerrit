      "message": "Sorry, I think I would probably be able to figure out what these mean eventually, but at the moment (after 5 minutes of thinking) I am lost. And I assume that the users will also be lost. So I think it is vital that we design the UX and the messaging for the end user first. Showing a warning is great, but the users should be able to understand what is going on in ~seconds.\n\nNaively, I would map each parent to either a change number (parent is a pending change) or to the name of the branch (parent is a commit in the target branch). If the parents of two patchsets map to something different, then show a warning like \"UNUSUAL REBASE WARNING: Patchset 1 was based on change 123, but patchset 2 is based directly on the target branch foo\".\n\nBonus points for also showing a warning when the change was rebased to something older: \"UNUSUAL REBASE WARNING: Patchset 1 was based on ps 3 of change 123, but the newer patchset 2 is based on the *older* ps 2 of change 123.\"\n\nWDYT?",
