The JavaDoc says to use this method to get the session for a context, but it seems this is no longer possible now that this method has been moved into ServerTestRule which is not accessible from outside of AbstractDaemonTest. So I wonder how the JavaDoc should be updated (to fix the broken JavaDoc link)?",
