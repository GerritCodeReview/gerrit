Supposing I even notice that this error message for change 69739 but I\u0027m trying to submit 69740, why do I care about this other change? At this point the whole screen is grayed out from the error message so I can\u0027t check the change ID on the \"submitted together\" screen.\n\nThe merge queue had helpful, descriptive, multi-sentence error messages when something went wrong. Here are some good examples:\nhttps://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/69691/1\n\nI think we should try to emulate those rather than being as succinct as possible, which is what this code feels like it\u0027s doing right now.",
