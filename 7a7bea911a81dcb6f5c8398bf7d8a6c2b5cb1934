      "message": "Ideally, this needs a test to ensure refs are updated correctly. That would be a bit tricky because we need to set `change.cacheAutomerge \u003d false`, create an auto-merge change, then set `change.cacheAutomerge \u003d true` and request the diff API.\n\nI anyway copied the code for updating the ref from AutoMerger (version prior to your change). So it should be fine.",
