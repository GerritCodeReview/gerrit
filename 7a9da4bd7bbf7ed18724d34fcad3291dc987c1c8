      "message": "Looking at this once more it is a really ugly workaround. I think the amount of plugins that need to inherit styles is really low, and I would suggest that we first try to force them all to become a Polymer component. It think that should not be very costly for plugin owners, and for us it makes life much simpler. WDYT?",

      "message": "agree its ugly and hard to maintain :( my initial thought was trying to reduce the work on their shoulders as much as possible. I guess I can make a cl to them to update their plugin and use that as an example of creating plugins that need to manipulate dom and include shared styles in polymer 2",
