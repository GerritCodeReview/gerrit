Should one of them be removed?\n\nThis was previously using AccessSection.ALL as AccessSection extends RefConfigSection. There is no such constant defined in AccessSection per se. In other files, AccessSection.ALL is also used based on that extends relationship, i.e., indirectly from RefConfigSection(.ALL).\n\nThat AccessSection.ALL usage could be on purpose, to make relying on AccessSection explicit, as opposed to its more abstract or generic parent RefConfigSection. I\u0027m now amending this accordingly, as I propose to stick to that practice found elsewhere in the code base.",
