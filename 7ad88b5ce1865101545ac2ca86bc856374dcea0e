Both ways are fine, and we can certainly follow up on that, but maybe not block this change.",

      "message": "I have removed `diffSide` from the data model of CommentThread. It does not have anything to do with the thread itself, but is rather a UI state of the parent component that is showing a comment thread in a diffing context. The property was only used by gr-diff and gr-diff-host and I have taken care that the diff is doing well without it, e.g. we keep setting the *attribute* for thread elements when adding them to a diff, which allows gr-diff to understand where it has to slot them in.",
