      "message": "ApprovalCopier got renamed to ApprovalInference, and then Edwin added the logging on it after it got renamed, but that change was done on master after stable-3.1 was cut.\n\nI backported the logging change to stable-2.16, where it was still ApprovalCopier.  Now the logging gets added here, and when it gets merged up to stable-3.2 there will be no change because that original change from Edwin is already there.",
