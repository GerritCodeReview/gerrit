      "message": "[optional] Do we need this additional field?\n\nIsn\u0027t it sufficient if the project field contains the defining project? The caller already knows for which project he was querying the dashboards so there is no need to return this project with every DashboardInfo.\n\nOn the other side this is much more explicit and easier to understand. Is this the reason why you want to have this additional field?",

      "message": "Yes it is sufficient, although I didn\u0027t realize it when I made this change.  I am starting to think that it might still be better to have the info for both though: 1) we have iterated so many times cleaning this stuff up that perhaps a little more explictness is a good thing? 2) What if someone was able to request a list of all the dashboards for every project, then it would need this info, and 3) While we can assume in our particular use case that the caller knows the intended \"destination\" project, I am not sure that this will always be the case, why not ensure that this data is always present?",
