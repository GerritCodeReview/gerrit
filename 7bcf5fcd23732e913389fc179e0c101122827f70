The existing design documents were actually abandoned, because they shouldn\u0027t be a part of gerrit.war. And the idea was to store them either in homepage repository to be self-hosted or in dedicated design repository, e.g. \"design\", see for example [1].\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/97245",
