      "message": "the temporary variable `fetchOptions` seems not been used at all, you can just do `req.fetchOptions \u003d Object.assing(req.fetchOptions || {}, {headers})` :)\n\nAnd will it still support the usage of `_fetchJSON(url)` ? from the test, seems it supports that usage before. If you still need to support that, you probably need to check on the type of `req` first",
