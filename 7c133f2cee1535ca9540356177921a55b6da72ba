All it does is to include STABLE_BUILD_GERRIT_LABEL into bazel-out/stable-status.txt.\n\n  $ grep JGIT bazel-out/stable-status.txt \n  STABLE_BUILD_JGIT_LABEL v5.12.0.202105051250-m2-3-ga9579ba60\n  \nWhether or not this label is actually used depends on JGit version used. So that we could de-couple stamping from actual JGit version bump. We could, but must not use JGit version that depends on the version stamping label be listed in bazel-out/stable-status.txt.",
