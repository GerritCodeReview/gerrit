We use positive numbers for the number of deleted lines for the rest of our code and APIs. That the events differ and don\u0027t even have tests is a bit concerning.",

The documentation for it (see Documentation/json.txt) doesn\u0027t mention anything about it, just \"Size information of deletions of this patchset\".\n\nAlso it seems there are not many places using it [1]. The only one that seems relevant is in its-base, but I don\u0027t know where (or if) it actually gets used. The corresponding test for it in its-base is using a positive number.\n\n[1] https://cs.bazel.build/search?q\u003dr%3Agerrit+sizeDeletions",
