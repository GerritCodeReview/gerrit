      "message": "In second thought leaking OrmException from SRE is, well, unfortunate. It\u0027s only needed to construct/retrieve ChangeControl. Looks like we could easily avoid this ugliness. Number of different approaches:\n\n* we could construct ChangeData with ChangControl, and provide another interface for ChangeData.changeControl() throws OrmException; that doesn\u0027t throw anything, say changeControlExists(). We could even checkNotNull() in this implementation. Justification: we have AssistedInject constructor that accepts ChangeControl and initilizes this instance in the ctor.\n* we could pass ChangeControl instance (that we have in all caller places) in SRE constructor and not bother to retrieve it from ChangeData at all.\n* Use a combintaion of two approaches above, something like this [1].\n\n [1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/120907",
