I would like it most if on the initial installation the default for installing would be Y for all plugins. On upgrade the default should be N (you didn\u0027t have the plugin before and it\u0027s likely that you still don\u0027t want it). \n\nA question could be what to do on upgrade when there is a new plugin which didn\u0027t exist before. I would be fine with either Y or N as default in this case. For simplicity I would go for N. Then it should be easy to implement: Initial site installation -\u003e default Y for all plugins; site upgrade -\u003e default for installing new plugins is N, but existing plugins are always upgraded.\n\n \u003e *But* in any events each and every plugin should be \n \u003e suggested to be upgraded by installer, when it\u0027s already \n \u003e installed on the Gerrit site.\n\n+1",
