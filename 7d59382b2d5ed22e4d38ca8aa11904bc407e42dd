      "message": "Yes, I think 10 minutes could also be a \u0027sane\u0027 default, but also 60 could be. It just depends. I just observed that my local Git client takes 10 minutes as timeout and taking a bit more as the default seems a good idea to me.\n\nAre you saying that I should make it 10 minutes? (as this is an unresolved comment)\n\nIf so, do you have a better argument than \"works for us\"?",
