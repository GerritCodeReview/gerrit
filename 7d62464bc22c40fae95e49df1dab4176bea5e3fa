      "message": "This exception will always be thrown if one of the repos has a series of changes that are chain-dependent. Suppose we had two repos R1 and R2 with some changes all part of a group. R1 has changes A and B, while R2 has change C. The problem seems to be that B will be marked unmergeable because A is not present during the test.\n\nThe fix would require some additional capabilities in MergeOp to let us check the mergeability of an entire group of changes, but there is change https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/23582 waiting out there that needs to be merged first to make this easier and avoid duplication.",
