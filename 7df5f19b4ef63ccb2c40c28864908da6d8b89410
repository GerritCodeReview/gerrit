I don\u0027t even know what will get put in the DynamicSet in that case.\n\nAnd even if the listener works, I don\u0027t see the utility of doing this, since it only affects instances during the short timeframe (perhaps milliseconds) between when they are created and destroyed. I feel like in that case it would be fine to just use the old config for that one request.",
