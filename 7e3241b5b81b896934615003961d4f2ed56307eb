      "message": "Yes, I wish I could do it now :-)\n\nThe problem is really the Gerrit init phase, which runs with a \"restricted\" runtime of Gerrit without most of injections available.\n\nWe should IMHO change the way Gerrit init works:\na) Start a full but minimal Gerrit anyway with a set of predefined settings that would always work\nb) Offer a full set of injections for the Init shell so that we can reuse the entire Gerrit infrastructure, including the plugin loader\nc) Optionally define a GUI version of the init, bringing a full Web-UX to its init phase\n\nHowever, this seems to be a much bigger change :-)",

      "message": "You\u0027re right that would be a big change. The main reason is that the very first injector that is created in normal Gerrit operation defines the database implementation used by gwtorm...which is read from gerrit.config, meaning the first time you run init it\u0027s not there yet.\n\nMaybe when we get rid of the database this will be easier ;)",
