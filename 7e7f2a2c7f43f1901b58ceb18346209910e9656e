      "message": "I\u0027m not sure 40 lines is \"significant\". Within the US there is some common opinion in the software legal circles that less than 250 lines of edits to a much larger existing work isn\u0027t copyrightable. This starts to fall into spelling and typographical corrections, which have already been held as not covered by copyright.\n\nFor example the Eclipse Foundation operates on this rule[1]. Within the EGit or JGit projects we would really resist adding a new copyright header for such a small contribution. Typically we only denote copyright for new files, or when there is really significant development added to an existing file, e.g. 1000 lines or more. We (and the Eclipse Foundation) are OK with this because the version control audit logs are freely available to anyone for inspection, and very clearly denote not just who made what contributions when, but also via blame/annotate whose contributions are still surviving in any particular version.\n\nWithin the Android Open Source Project umbrella, for sources that are licensed under the BSD and Apache License 2.0 we only use the \"Copyright (c) 20xx The Android Open Source Project\". This line gives sufficient notice that the work is protected by copyright within the confines of US law, which is often sufficient enough protection for any global software development activity. (Many companies only get US copyright and expect other countries to honor it by way of treaty.)\n\nHowever the terms of the BSD and Apache License are so liberal that its impractical to really prosecute a mis-use of software that was licensed under either of these licenses. This is especially true when each individual contributor retains copyright. There are too many copyright holders in Gerrit Code Review for example to make it practical for us to prosecute a copyright infringement case. It would require 40+ plaintiffs on one side of the table, and given how liberal the license\u0027s terms are, the judge would probably wonder what the copyright holders are even trying to obtain from the infringing party.\n\nLong story short, in my (non-legal !) opinion, we do not need to add copyright headers for each contribution, and thus I resist doing it because it clutters the file headers.\n\nThe Git revision metadata (which includes the authorship) is as much a part of the project as the source files themselves, and accurately denotes what was contributed, by whom, and when. Git can accurately compute current ownership on any revision. The revision metadata is as freely available to everyone as the files themselves are, and indeed, if you want the source files, the best way to obtain them is to also obtain the revision metadata. At which point you can obtain the complete ownership set yourself without relying on contributors to denote it themselves. (This last point is actually pretty relevant since in the US copyright is automatic, even if not declared in the file by the author.) I probably should also point out it is common in copyright infringement cases to obtain version control history logs during discovery because the file headers cannot be fully trusted. With Git and open source projects (especially under the Android Open Source Project umbrella) those logs are available to anyone, at anytime.\n\nAlso, because Gerrit is a collaborative work, with over 40 different copyright holders on it (and growing), given notice for every single one of these copyright holders per the Apache License terms is becoming more and more difficult. End-users who receive the sources or binary distribution don\u0027t care that Bob Smith or Jane Doe provided some parts anymore than I care that John Davies may have helped to edit the definition of \"is\" in the newest dictionary I picked up at the store. They do however care that the larger \"Android Open Source Project\" team is the group that was responsible for the product, and that is who they would contact to try and make different licensing arrangements, or give credit to.\n\nSorry, I\u0027m not a lawyer, and I can\u0027t play one on code reviews. But I can say that we feel we don\u0027t need any headers beyond the \"Copyright ... The Android Open Source Project\". (I feel the same way about JGit, but the Eclipse Foundation is only half-way through the above argument so... not quite there yet.)\n\n[1] http://www.eclipse.org/legal/EclipseLegalProcessPoster.pdf",
