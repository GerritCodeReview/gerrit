Let\u0027s discuss this more.\n\nBut maybe it is a bad user experience anyway to load/show the diff with one set of comments and then (suddenly) reload it with another set of (ported) comments. Maybe we should just wait for the ported comments, and only then show the diff.\n\nAlso note that gr-diff has a (weird) _observeNodes() mechanism for listening on newly attached comment threads. Maybe this could be changed to expand collapsed diff chunks, if ported comments are attached to collapsed lines? I mean if we decide to go for that kind of UX.",
