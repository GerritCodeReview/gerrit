I\u0027d like to avoid ending up with GR-REPORTING having a huge number of methods that are only invoked once each. IMO the method should be at-least-slightly generic.\n\nIn PS3 I add a `reportInteraction` method on GR-REPORTING. In this way, the details of the report that have to do with the messages list can appear in the messages list element.\n\nDo you think we need to have better documentation of what events get invoked? I can imagine a spreadsheet of all the reporting strings we use, in what cases they apply, what versions they were added in, etc..",

I\u0027d like to avoid ending up with GR-REPORTING having a huge number of methods that are only invoked once each. IMO the method should be at-least-slightly generic.\n\nI think this is a general decomposition question - and gr-rest-api is another good example of this.\nBreaking it down is definitely a good components-based architecture way for moving forward.\nIt also might be possible to create concrete sub-APIs that use gr-reporting for the actual operation - either as elements or as JS classes.\n\n\u003e Do you think we need to have better documentation of what events get invoked?
