      "message": "This is about pushes made directly to a change branch. E.g. if you push some SHA1 to refs/changes/nnnn and SHA1 is already merged into the branch, Gerrit closes the change for you, after updating the change with SHA1 as the latest and most recent patch set.\n\nI propose we delete support for that entirely... which then allows us to remove this check. So I think you are right, its reverting the fix for issue GERRIT-54. But I don\u0027t think anyone really uses Gerrit like that anymore. Not since we really started pushing people to use the Change-Id footers.",
