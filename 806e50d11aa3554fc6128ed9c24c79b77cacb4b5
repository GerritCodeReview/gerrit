And hence the query send to the index somehow defaults to status:open?? But I didn\u0027t find where this is happaning :-/",

There are others that behave in the same way.  \"reviewerin:\" is one of them, and is tested in the following change.\n\nAs far as I can see \"destination:\" too, but that\u0027s not as easy to test because it needs additional config before it works.
