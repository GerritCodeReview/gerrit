      "message": "I would be great if we could make this change handle more than one API per plugin (and gives them names to differentiate them). Maybe we could use an annotation, say @PublicModule(\"ApiName\") to do that, and then allow more than one Gerrit-Module entry in the jar MANIFEST to be listed? Something like this:\n\n manifest_entries \u003d [\n   \"Gerrit-Module: com...MainSysModule\",\n   \"Gerrit-Module: com...MyFooApiModule\",\n   \"Gerrit-Module: com...MyBarModule\"\n ]\n\n @PublicModule(\"Foo\") \n public class MyFooApiModule implements Module {...}\n\n @PublicModule(\"Bar\") \n public class MyBarApiModule implements Module {...}\n\n\nThis approach might also allow us to support HTTP and SSH specific versions in the future if needed:\n\n manifest_entries \u003d [\n   \"Gerrit-Module: com...MainSysModule\",\n   \"Gerrit-HttpModule: com...MyFooApiModule\",\n   \"Gerrit-SshModule: com...MyBarModule\"\n ]\n\n @PublicModule(\"Foo\") \n public class MyFooApiModule implements HttpModule {...}\n \n @PublicModule(\"Bar\")\n public class MyBarApiModule implements SshModule {...}",

      "message": "Why would I want this?\n\n1) I think the ability to package an API with the plugin implementing the API is a neat feature (aggregation), as it prevents plugin jar file proliferation and makes it easier for an admin to manage the plugins, as they will not need to install multiple jars to do related things, and load ordering becomes less of a problem. So it would be great if we could improve this feature to handle multiple APIs in the same plugin.\n\n2) I would like to support multiple APIs in the same plugin in order to:\n\n2a) and to support independent loading. Imagine pluginA with API1 that needs to be chained to pluginB-API, and pluginA\u0027s API2 that does not. Still being able to load pluginsA\u0027s API2 even when pluginB-API is not install is important.\n\n2b) support APIs with conflicting types in them. For example:\n\n Plugin-APIV1  public Foo getFooV1();\n Plugin-APIV2  public Foo getFooV2();\n\nWhere both APIs use a Class named \"Foo\", but perhaps they are classes from two different versions of a library. If they are in separate APIs, then there definitions can be different yet they can still be loaded since they would presumably have different classloaders. This situation is likely to happen with \"chained\" apis, where pluginA exposes two different APIs that uses a APIs from two plugins, pluginsB and pluginC. PluginB and PluginC both use a common library such as an XML parser, but they use different versions.\n\n PluginA-APIchainspluginB  public String filter(String xml) {\n                Xml \u003d pluginBApi.parseXml1(xml);\n                ...\n              }\n\n PluginA-APIchainspluginC  public String addProperty(String xml, String property) {\n                Xml \u003d pluginCApi.parseXml2(xml);\n                ...\n              }\n\n PluginB-API  public Xml parseXml1(String xml);\n PluginC-API  public Xml parseXml2(String xml);",

      "message": "\u003e 2b) support APIs with conflicting types in them. For example:\n\nThe example didn\u0027t come out so nice, here is hopefully a better way to describe it:\n\nThis situation is likely to happen with \"chained\" apis, where plugin Foo exposes two different APIs (Foo-ManifestApi, and Foo-PomApi) that use APIs from two different plugins, the Manifest and Pom plugins. The Manifest and Pom plugins both use a common library such as an XML parser, but they use different versions that cause conflicts:\n\n* The Manifest-Api plugin exports this method which depends on Version-1.0 of an XML library:\n\n  public Xml parseXml(String xml);\n\n* The Pom-Api plugin exports this method which depends on Version-2.0 of an XML library:\n\n  public Xml parseXml(Url url);\n\n* The Xml class from version-1.0 is not compatible with the Xml class from version-2.0. If the APIs above were loaded in the same Classloader, likely only the first one would get loaded, and if it isn\u0027t the same as the second one, it would likely result in \"NoSuchMethod\" runtime errors as the other one tries to access a method which is different. \n\n* Plugin Foo needs to export the following APIs:\n\n  public Xml getManifestXml(Branch.NameKey branch, Sting manifestFile); // Using Xml from version-1.0\n  public Xml addPropertyToPom(Url url, String property) // Using Xml from version-2.0\n\nSo to deal with this, plugin Foo isolates those methods by offering two APIs:\n\n* Plugin Foo-ManifestApi\u0027s implementation uses the Manifest-Api plugin:\n\n  public Xml getManifestXml(Branch.NameKey branch, Sting manifestFile) {\n    ...\n    return manifestApi.parseXml(xml);\n  }\n\n* Plugin Foo-PomApi\u0027s implementation uses the Pom-Api plugin:\n\n  public Xml addPropertyToPom(Url url, String property) {\n    Xml xml \u003d pomApi.parseXml(url);\n    ...\n    return xml;\n  }\n\nWhile this is still a made up example, I hope that helps clarify why this might be needed to provide isolation when chaining APIs.",
