Most servers don\u0027t want to, and there are plenty of brain-damaged ways that access to the local filesystem might be granted accidentally if we allow either / or \\ in the path here.\n\nOne of them is Windows UNC paths. There are so many ways those behave funny that I just don\u0027t want to trust Java\u0027s getCanonicalFile to save me from them. Not in a default installation anyway.",
