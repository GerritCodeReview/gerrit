The performance impact comes with adding the DRAFT_COMMENTS option below. This option fires one SQL statement per patch set to load the draft comments of the user.\nThe question is, if this is okay, or if we need a new REST endpoint for this, that can be fired in the background and which highlights the Reply button asynchronously.\n\n \u003e I get the feeling that draft comments are more likely to \n \u003e be present on later patch sets than older ones, so would \n \u003e it make sense to iterate over the revisions in \n \u003e descending order so we can exit this loop early?\n\nDone",
