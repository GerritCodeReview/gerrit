      "message": "The code looks good for me.\nHowever, sometimes it doesn\u0027t work as expected - the _labelsChanged is true and hasVote is true too.\nThis happens when this.$.labelScores.getLabelValues() returns one or more items with 0 score (i.e. usually it doesn\u0027t return anything, but after some actions it returns labels with 0 values).\nI haven\u0027t found the exact steps to reproduce it, but this happens quite often. What I did: i added/removed myself as a reviewer, and voted. But still don\u0027t understand how to reproduce it. Page reload doesn\u0027t solve it - once the issue appears for a change it doesn\u0027t disappear after reloading the page.\nHave you noticed anything similar?",
