The original patch is a Gerrit patch (which is correct for the current use case, but highly limiting the functionality of this endpoint).\n2. The author we want to list as the patch-applier is the same one who created the original patch. Given the patch is a text that can be manually edited before getting applied - this might result in some security issues.\n3. Currently, the implementation completely ignores the Gerrit-patch metadata. I can add this support, but then again - potential security issues.\n\n\u003e Why do we have both ApplyPatchAsPatchSetInput and ApplyPatchInput? As a name `ApplyPatchAsPatchSetInput` looks out of style with the rest of the API. Because `ApplyPatchInput` has just a single string inside, it looks superfluous.\n\nThe intention was to align with [MergePatchSetInput](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#merge-patch-set-input) which contains a [MergeInput](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#merge-input) field. I agree that ApplyPatchInput is currently easy to replace with a string, but if we ever need to add some extra common fields (e.g. encoding config) - it will be much easier with the current wrapper. I don\u0027t feel strongly about it though.",
