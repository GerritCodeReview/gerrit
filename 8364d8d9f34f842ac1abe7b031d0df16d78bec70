I see they are in 3.1 but I haven\u0027t merged them myself...sorry for the confusion, my bad üòê\n\nNo issue, they\u0027re in 3.1 just because that version branched off master after you introduced them (in master). -Or so I suspect. They currently then need to be maintained from stable-3.1 then upstream (master). Thus the branch I used for this very change (stable-3.1). We can eventually consider cherry-picking those tests in downstream branches, as needed.",
