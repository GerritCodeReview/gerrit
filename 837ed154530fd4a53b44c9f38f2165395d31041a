      "message": "I think it works iff `_admin` is assigned after `draft`. Based on the way that the element is used, `draft` should be set when `ready` is called.\n\nHowever, `_admin` is assigned after a promise that\u0027s invoked from `attached`. Does this mean there is a race condition if the admin request resolves before `ready` is called? I\u0027m not certain. \n\nMaybe the admin should be called from `ready`? Alternatively, we can try to resolve the undefined `draft` problem so we can use it in the binding normally.\n\nA third option, we declare a new _isDraft parameter that is initialized to false, and is computed from the regular draft property. Then we can use _isDraft with a regular binding.",
