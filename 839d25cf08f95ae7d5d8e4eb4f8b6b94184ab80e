However, I believe that we want to see it.\n\nFurther, this will be done single-threaded for the whole project (just like offline reindexing does).\n\nHowever, I wonder what you will do in a future change when you allow reindexing of a set of changes based on a time interval? I guess you will submit one indexing task per change and utilize the index.[batch]threads thread pool?\nIt may be surprising to admins that some reindexing commands utilize that thread pool and others don\u0027t.",
