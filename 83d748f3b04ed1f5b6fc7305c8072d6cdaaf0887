      "message": "If there is a chance of discrepancy, do we not want it to be a draft?  If change says draft, but not the ps, then not a draft?  This begs the question, should there really be a draft flag on a change, or should the lack of a non-draft ps indicate that the change is still in draft mode?  In other words, what would it mean for a Change to be new, but to not have any published patch sets?",

      "message": "The intent is to make it impossible to have a non-draft PS and a draft change. The publishing of a draft PS or submitting a non-draft PS to a draft change irreversibly upgrades the change\u0027s status from draft to new. In other words, draft changes should only consist of draft patchsets.\n\nThe idea of doing a draft change status is to prevent the need to constantly check every single patch set in every single change to see if the change consists of only draft patch sets. That way, it\u0027s easier to hide an entire change from the list of changes if that change consists of only draft patchsets and the user doesn\u0027t have access.",
