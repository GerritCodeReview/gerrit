      "message": "If there is a chance of discrepancy, do we not want it to be a draft?  If change says draft, but not the ps, then not a draft?  This begs the question, should there really be a draft flag on a change, or should the lack of a non-draft ps indicate that the change is still in draft mode?  In other words, what would it mean for a Change to be new, but to not have any published patch sets?",
