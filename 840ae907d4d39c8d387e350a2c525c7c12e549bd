      "message": "Moving this check to SubmitRuleEvaluator.canSubmit() looks wrong (and the log sems to be lost in follow-up changes). Because we have two different use cases: Real- and Test-Mode.\nIn real mode only current patch sets are allowed, whereas in test mode arbitrary patch sets can be used. Because for now SRE doesn\u0027t know whar kind of caller invokes canSubmit() method, this check must stay here.",

      "message": "So my thinking was, it is fair to push this out to callers, which is why I got rid of it.\n\nI thought the only place we really cared was Submit, where there is already a check that it\u0027s the most recent patch set, so having it here would be redundant.\n\nBut I thought I\u0027d double-check the other callers.\n\n* ChangeJson.submitRecords() always calls with the current PS\n* QueryProcessor.query() always calls with the current PS\n* PostReviewers and ReviewerJson always use the current PS (since they are change views, not revision views)\n\nSo I don\u0027t see a behavioral change from dropping this check.",
