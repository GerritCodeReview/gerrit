So I shouldn\u0027t add border to this [Code-Review +1] in change log?\n\n\u003eFor code-review the specs colors are applied but not for other labels, like Verified.\n2. This is because Verified max value is +1, so it behaves like +2 in Code Review + 2\n\n\u003eWe also need to address the dark theme issue of changing to white font + I propose we add borders to the +1 /-1 voting chips for improving contrast in dark theme.\n3. Let\u0027s address dark theme in separate change, if you are ok with it. I will prepare it after we finish this one.",

      "message": "1. Yes we add the border too for voting chips +1 and -1 in the change log. But now the chips have fully rounded corner, radius 100% for the voting labels like Code Review +1 or Verified +1 in the change log. Before, the radius was not fully rounded, the chips looked like rectangle with 4px radius in the change log only. I propose we keep them as is without fully rounded corners for now, only for the voting labels in the change log. \n\n2. Ok then let\u0027s keep as is because these will need more changes to the chips definition and it goes beyond colors.\n\n3. Sounds good, can review today if you have it ready.",
