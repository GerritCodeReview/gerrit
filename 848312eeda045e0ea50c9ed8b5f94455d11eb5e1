So I shouldn\u0027t add border to this [Code-Review +1] in change log?\n\n\u003eFor code-review the specs colors are applied but not for other labels, like Verified.\n2. This is because Verified max value is +1, so it behaves like +2 in Code Review + 2\n\n\u003eWe also need to address the dark theme issue of changing to white font + I propose we add borders to the +1 /-1 voting chips for improving contrast in dark theme.\n3. Let\u0027s address dark theme in separate change, if you are ok with it. I will prepare it after we finish this one.",
