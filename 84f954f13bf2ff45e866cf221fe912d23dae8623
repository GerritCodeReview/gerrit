      "message": "refs/changes/ only takes a number and not a branch as argument.\n\nSo, it\u0027s either refs/for/branch, or it\u0027s refs/changes/change-id-number\n\nIf you don\u0027t use your change-id commit message hook, you have to use refs/changes/change-id-number to upload new patchsets. With the hook installed, it\u0027s a matter of personal preference. Usually it\u0027s more convenient to upload to a static reference, i.e. refs/for/branch.\n\nDo you think there\u0027s something missing in the documentation to show this? If so, we should probably improve upon it.",
