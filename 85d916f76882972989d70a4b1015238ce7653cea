It would make the banner show up more consistently across editable space in Gerrit (everywhere gr-comment is in editing mode for AOSP).\n\nThere is not an existing bottom section gr-endpoint-decorator in gr-comment to hook into however, and I\u0027d need a similar gr-endpoint-param for `editing` field.\n\nWDYT?",
