When I pass in the commit id it works correctly but either way the tests pass. I\u0027ll write or modify a test before submitting a new patch set.",

If we make F mergeable by making it a child of C instead of B, G becomes mergeable since it\u0027s the last in the chain.\n\nI need help finding a case which would fail the test if \"isLastInChain\" is simply ignored (always true), I wish I could do this alone sorry for invoking so much help :p.",
