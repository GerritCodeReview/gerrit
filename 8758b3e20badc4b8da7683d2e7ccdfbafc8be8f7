      "message": "Using a SecureByteArrayOutputStream (\"secure\" in the sense that it clears out any internal buffers) would make sense only if the stream was also closed. Use a try-with-resource, or, if you don\u0027t care since it\u0027s only ephemeral test keys and not encrypted either, a simple ByteArrayOutputStream.\n\nOr, since sshd should also be able to read unencrypted PKCS#8, just use that always. (If it works in sshd. I\u0027ve never tried it. sshd is, however, apparently not able to read encrypted PKCS#8. At least I don\u0027t see any code to do so.)",
