      "message": "AFAIU `\u003c0` means that NO bitmap index exists, correct?\nIs value meaningful? IOW if we have 2 calls for missing bitmap index would it be `-2` then? If yes maybe we should rather `record(op, -bitmapIndexMisses)` so that number of misses is reflected rather than just the fact that they occurred? Again if value is recorded then the description of the metric could/should be also modified?",
