      "message": "i don\u0027t like this for several reasons:\n- the use case itself: it\u0027s really kinda a dangerous policy to \"overload\" git\u0027s scheme. it would be safer to use a custom one, like \"FIXUP:\" or \"fixup!!\".\n- this puts the change solidly into \"feature\" land.\n- arguably, it should be separated from the originally intended fix.\n- it actively counteracts the performance argument (not as badly for excluded commits, but it\u0027s a constant overhead for the common case), and given the questionable use case, it seems hard to justify imo.",

      "message": "1. If I understand @nasser.grainawi@linaro.org correctly, they *do* push fixup! commits, and they intend to rebase them later using git built-in mechanics.\n2. Agreed.\n3. Can be done, I meant to include the \"break and fix\" in the same commit.\n4. The performance issue was there before (git config was done before the squash check). Before Nasser\u0027s comment, I actually intended to swap them to improve performance (in a separate commit).",

      "message": "re 1: yeah, but they risk that they will accidentally autosquash them too early. it would be safer to use a different scheme, and when it comes to actually squashing, rewrite the commits first (with `git filter-repo`).\n\nre 4: right, that occurred to me as well. but then, the option seems a bit pointless to me in the first place ... why install the hook at all if you don\u0027t intend to use it? or install a different one? the configuration is per repo anyway. ah, well - too late anyway.",
