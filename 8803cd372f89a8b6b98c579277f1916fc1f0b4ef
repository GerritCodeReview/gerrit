      "message": "\u003e This has been created in a separate class (whilst it was on the Change class on master) because of dependency issues with JGit. It can be then fully discarded when merging it up to master.\n\nThe reason why com.google.gerrit.reviewdb.client.Change cannot depend on SecureRandom is GWT UI. That why thre should be a new place for it. It must not be a new file, right? May be find another utility class to park that code, e.g.: CommitMessageUtil.java? Moreover, given that 2.16 is still supported, we should avoid adding GWT UI incomptible code there to make cherry-pick to stable-2.16 easier. That why we should consider to move SecureRandom code out of the Change, to CommitMessageUtil or another util class.\n\nWe could do that change on master first (move SecureRandom out from Change to CommitMessageUtil), merge it, and then re-do this chery-pick. That way we wouldn\u0027t mess around with merge conflicts across different code paths and yet another conflict resolution during merging it up to master.",
