When will it be null, or an empty object, or whatever falsy value it attains? There must be some reason you check here for reference equality to undefined, as opposed to just checking if (!latest).

So I\u0027ve moved handling there as well.\n\nLet me know if this looks better.",

It isn\u0027t immediately clear in this code why this check must be specifically for undefined -- IMO, situations like these are what comments are for.",
