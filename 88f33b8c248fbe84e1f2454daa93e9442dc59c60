      "message": "As a discussion for the entire capability section, it\u0027s worth noting that there are several formatting practices throughout the documentation.\nOne of them is the one I have here, which is the bigger headline with a line of ~-chars under it.\n\nCreate group\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nAnother foramtting practice can be seen here https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#_a_id_cache_a_section_cache, and is arguably smaller and neater. On the other hand it\u0027s not listed in the table of contents which I perceive as a drawback.\n\nCreate group::\n\nSo, I\u0027d like to make a poll, which version gives the better overview and readability?
