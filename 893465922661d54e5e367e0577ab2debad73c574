      "message": "I considered that. This would indeed be another possibility, but I still believe this is better because:\n- TokenHighlightLayer is not created internally in gr-diff, but in gr-diff-host (and equivalents). Therefore it is already in a way exposed behavior controlled by the gr-diff client.\n- Here we notify both events - when a token getshighlighted and when it stops being highlighted. While the first is easy to associate to a specific HTMLElement, the second might be trickier: We could even trigger an event in the previously selected HTMLElement for the token, but I\u0027m not sure if we can guarantee it is still available in the page (e.g. a file got closed in the CL Page?). I would mostly like to avoid potential edge cases in this area if we don\u0027t have to. \n\nDoes that make sense? I could try to change it into a DOM event but I personally don\u0027t believe it\u0027s worth it taken these bullet points into account.",
