It only creates the CHANGE_LABELS table, but it doesn\u0027t add any label change permissions to the APPROVAL_CATEGORIES and APPROVAL_CATEGORY_VALUES tables.\n\n2. This change is just about the ChangeLabel table. The population of APPROVAL_CATEGORIES and APPROVAL_CATEGORY_VALUES with the label change permissions if needed seems to belong to change 24660 [1]. Actually I think APPROVAL_CATEGORIES and APPROVAL_CATEGORY_VALUES don\u0027t need to be updated (see my comment on patch set 3 of change 24660 [1]). Anyway if APPROVAL_CATEGORIES and APPROVAL_CATEGORY_VALUES need to be populated with the label change permissions I would then propose to have another schema migration in change 24660. In this case the commit message above should be adapted.\n\n[1] https://review.source.android.com/24660",
