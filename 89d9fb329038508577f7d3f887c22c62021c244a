I think it also solves the challenge of searching by a change # and getting duplicate results (it looks like the virtual id isn\u0027t used consistently)? Related, I just noticed the `TODO: To be reverted on master and stable-3.8` lines for the virtual id algo were included in `18b18957476f56c019e1f39ab6df445292d58f2c` (the cherry-pick to stable-3.8) and are still on master. It seems like the work for master isn\u0027t complete yet, so I\u0027m trying to understand what\u0027s left there (if it\u0027s not adding a new required serverId field to the index).",
