Note that I only changed hastahs() but analytics plugin would probably need the access to other methods as well?\n\nKind of a hack would be to add ChangeNotesStateAccessor class to Analytics plugin in the package, like the current one, and add public getter-methods for every attribute in this class, and use this new class from other places in analytics plugin.",
