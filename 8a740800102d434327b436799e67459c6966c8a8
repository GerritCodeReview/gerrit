      "message": "Due to change id calculation algorithm, the probability, that two changes with the same change-id will exist on the same branch are high, if they were created with inline edit in the same time (there was an issue raised recently). \n\nAfter this change this would be broken. Even if I think this is a good change and we should do it, can we add some notice to the release notes, or otherwise communicate that intrusive change? One way would be to explicitly log in error log what exactly happened and why. hat way gerrit site administrator could for example delete problematic change.",
