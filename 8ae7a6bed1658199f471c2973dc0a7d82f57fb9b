      "message": "I think this line is not forward compatible and might fail if we did roll-fw / roll-back.\n\nIf you submit this change, new binaries will start writing the protos without the assignee field (serialize method does not store it anymore - line 522 that you removed). If we rolled back the binary for any reason, old releases will execute this line (try to parse the assignee list from the proto) but the proto won\u0027t have that field and it will fail.\n\nTo make this safe, please split this change into two: the first change should only make the server stop reading the assignee field from the serialized proto (i.e. only modify the deserialize method - also adapt the test). We can roll this change and wait for a while then submit another change to stop writing this field to the proto.\n\nAlternative:\nWe can update this line to make it safe w.r.t. for compatibility, i.e. add a condition that makes sure the field is set before accessing it.",

      "message": "The scenario happens when there are two versions of the server (code_old, code_new) and two versions of the data (data_old, data_new).\n\nThis change in itself is fine. Today {code_old} writes {data_old}. When this change rolls out, {code_new} will write {data_new}. Writing here means persisting the data since persisted caches are serialized and stored on disk.\n\nIf for any reason we needed to rollback the release thereafter, {code_old} will be running but trying to parse {data_new} that was written previously by the {code_new}. {code_old} (i.e. this line we\u0027re commenting on) will be executed and will fail since the new Proto does not have the assignee field.\n\nI\u0027d be careful doing this change, either by splitting the change or testing this scenario with some test code and see if it will work.\n\nHappy to chat offline about this if it\u0027s still unclear.",
