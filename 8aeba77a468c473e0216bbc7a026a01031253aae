      "message": "\u003e I think that private is orthogonal to WIP change\n\nYes, absolutely. Doesn\u0027t technically preclude having a dropdown, but all 4 possibilities are valid, so a dropdown would have to have all of them.\n\n\u003e and New change\n\nWhat is a \"New change\"? Are you referring to the Change.Status constant? That doesn\u0027t make sense, the change will always be in state NEW when it\u0027s created. Moreover, I think it would be rather confusing for users to click \"Create change\" and then be presented with a dropdown where only *one* of the options is \"New change\". The obvious reaction is: \"Of course I want a new change, that\u0027s why I clicked Create Change!\" But if you\u0027re using \"new\" to mean \"not WIP\", that initial reaction is wrong, because there are perfectly good reasons why the user wants a WIP change.\n\n\u003e I think we could have a dropdown for WIP/new and a separate checkbox for private. Though I\u0027d like to hear @loganhanks @dborowitz thoughts on that.\n\nI would slightly prefer checkboxes for both, but I don\u0027t feel strongly.\n\nActually, I think I would really prefer if it _always_ set WIP and didn\u0027t give users the option. Private could be a checkbox.",
