It seems like the reason we weren\u0027t doing that was to avoid having to walk the parent tree at initialization time. But I\u0027m not actually sure that is a good argument; for most of these, some caller is practically guaranteed to want to call the method at some point in the cache entry\u0027s lifetime.\n\nPlus, walking the parent tree multiple times has drawbacks of its own:\n\n* It does repeated lookups of the same cache keys. One could imagine an inheritance hierarchy like All-Projects \u003e Foo-Projects \u003e foo{1..100} where Foo-Projects itself might fall out of the cache periodically.\n* It\u0027s theoretically possible for the parent tree to change in between calls to lazy-loading methods, which would produce a weirdly inconsistent cache entry.\n\nIf we walk the parent tree eagerly at construction time, then at least all the fields that depend on parents would see a consistent list. (BTW I also just noticed there is a rare race that could produce an infinite loop if a parent-child relationship is inverted in the middle of iteration.)\n\n\nI think the main thing that can\u0027t or shouldn\u0027t be computed eagerly is the plugin configs. There may be arbitrary files in the tree which may or may not be understandable by the current set of installed plugins, so we can\u0027t just eagerly parse all files or anything.\n\nBut it\u0027s clear we have to do *something* about the plugin configs, because ProjectLevelConfig right now holds a reference to ProjectState, and it\u0027s also probably not threadsafe :(",

Later, we change \"parent\"\u0027s parent from All-Projects to \"grantparent\". When we call projectCache.get(\"child\").getAllSections(), we want to walk child -\u003e parent -\u003e grandparent -\u003e All-Projects. If we precompute and cache the results of getAllSections() in child\u0027s constructor, we won\u0027t pick up the new parent hierarchy.\n\nThis wouldn\u0027t be a problem if we could invalidate the cache for \"child\" when \"parent\" is updated. But we don\u0027t currently record descendant projects anywhere, except in the project index, which I don\u0027t think we should treat as reliable for the purposes of cache invalidation.",
