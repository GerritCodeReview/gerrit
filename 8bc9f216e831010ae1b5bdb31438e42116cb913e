Otherwise we grant them more general limits?\n\nIts ugly to limit things by the predicate of the query.",

      "message": "I was only asking if it might be confusing to someone if we do not do this piece: \"Or only to owners of the All-Projects that this capability data resides in?\"\n\nBut, it does seem strange to do that piece, since despite the global limits being stored in All-Projects, it isn\u0027t really a feature of the \"project\" All-Projects (and thus meriting owners evaluation) so much as it is a feature of a global config.  So, ideally, if we care about this potential confusion (I am not sure we even do) I would almost suggest having a different place besides All-Projects to add things which are not \"project like\" so that this \"owners\" with respect to All-Projects question never comes up again.",

The other place to put this stuff is in gerrit.config... but you cannot edit that from the web UI.\n\nAs part of the \"git-store\" stuff, I\u0027m thinking about moving a lot of the contents of $site_dir/etc into All-Projects.git\u0027s refs/meta/config branch.
