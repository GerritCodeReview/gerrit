If I was added as reviewer to two changes, A and B, and both changes are now in the WIP state, and change A\u0027s hasReviewStarted is true, while change\u0027s B hasReviewStarted is false, I still expect to not get any notification from both changes (say on new patch set uploaded event), no matter if they were ever in non WIP state or not. Or may be I\u0027m missing what notification type exactly are you talking about? What would be differently to me as reviewer for those two changes A and B?",

Again, the guiding ideal is, if I haven\u0027t heard about this issue before, I don\u0027t want to hear about it now. If I create a WIP change with pending reviewers and publish a comment explaining something in advance, that shouldn\u0027t go to my reviewers. If I start review and return to WIP later, I do want those comments to notify everyone, because the ongoing conversation is not necessarily in sync with the work that\u0027s in progress.",
