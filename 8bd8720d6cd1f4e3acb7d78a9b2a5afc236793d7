If I was added as reviewer to two changes, A and B, and both changes are now in the WIP state, and change A\u0027s hasReviewStarted is true, while change\u0027s B hasReviewStarted is false, I still expect to not get any notification from both changes (say on new patch set uploaded event), no matter if they were ever in non WIP state or not. Or may be I\u0027m missing what notification type exactly are you talking about? What would be differently to me as reviewer for those two changes A and B?",

But for already previously existing reviewers (before change entered the WIP state) another notification would be send, that the change is Ready now? These are very subtle nuances.",
