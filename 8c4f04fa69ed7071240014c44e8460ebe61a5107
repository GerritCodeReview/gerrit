      "message": "It is way better now, an I could probably be convinced to accept that \"fix\" with the current intermediate state, but, I am still not happy with this solution. (I know, we can bikeshed that topic indefinitely, but it\u0027s not me who started the bikeshed process).\n\nSo what I am after is to undo as much as possible from changes in: [1]. And only do a minimal invasive/cosmetic change to satisfy new Gerrit developers. Remember: it is not the final solution, but a interim state.\n\nPrimary reason is because I am against changing the semantic of the existig action and moving it around in other part of the UI and doing completely different thing: no amending reviewer or leaving a comment thing. This is what you should generally never do, and much less as a part of interim solution. I would procrastenate with that move until design team will conduct extensive UI/UX research and come to the final conclusion (may be even with design process suggested by Matthias Sohn).\n\nSo my favorite interim solution fix would still be (as discussed in the issue linked to this CL):\n\n* 1. Restore the original button name for Reply button: \"Start Review\" that is the only primary button (blue). Alternatively: rename it in \"Reply and Start Review\": most importantly, keep: \"Start Review\" as part of its name, like it was in the past.\n* 2. Find another name for the new, de-emphasized button that only flipping the WIP bit, but *not* offering amend reviewers and/or leaving a message, e.g.: \"Mark as Ready\". Alternatively: \"Set Ready\" or just \"Ready\".\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/256995",

      "message": "\u003e And I would prefer that a prominent button did not change name and action, which I consider poor UX.\n\nBut this is exactly what: [1] did: it renamed primary button behind Reply dialog from \"Start Review\" to \"Reply\", while still leaving the primary action in the dialog itself: \"Sent and Start Review\". It\u0027s not just \"poor UX\", it is counter productive and will confuse everyone.\n\nDo you see \"Start Review\" part in the primary action in the dialog. Also note, that \"Reply\" is very bad choice! Why? Because you cannot reply at all in WIP state. The notification firehouse is switched off. You can only Save the comments.\n\nIf: [1] would de-couple \"Start Review\" action from Popup Dialog, and remove \"Send and Start Review\" button entirely, only leaving \"Cancel\" | \"Save\" actions, then, and only then it would be justified to remove \"Start Review\" part from the existing button.\n\nI don\u0027t have opinion on the mentioned de-coupling: UI experts would have to investigate the whole voting/amending reviewer/leaving comment/WIP \u003c-\u003e Ready bit flip area and make a conclusion (but you would probably get a shit storm from users who would require two clicks: 1/ amend reviewers in the popup dialog, 2/ close the dialog and click primary standalone button \"Ready for review\"). I only wanted to emphasize why it was wrong to rename the button in: [1], and what condition must be met to rename the button: amend the primary action in the dialog itself!",
