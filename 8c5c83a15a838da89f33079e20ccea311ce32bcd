Actually all core plugins which have been recently added are plugins that are not used by Google (plugin-manager [1], gitiles [2], webhooks [3], delete-project [4]).\n\n\u003e If not, does it make sense for google (or any company\u0027s) employees to have overriding\n\u003e direction on plugins they don\u0027t use?\n\nAccording to our project governance the ESC is in charge of Gerrit core and the core plugins [1]. If ESC authority is not wanted for a plugin, it should not be a core plugin. \n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/221236\n[2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/210959\n[3] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/206726\n[4] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/203712\n[5] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-processes.html#steering-committee",
