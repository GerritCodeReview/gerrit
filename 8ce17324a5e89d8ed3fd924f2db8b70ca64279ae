I just don\u0027t know where the right place to document the delineation is. I\u0027d love to somehow make this less confusing. One thing I\u0027d like to do (probably in a later patch set) is rename this `editLoaded` property to `editMode` throughout the app, just to more clearly indicate it is different from `editPatchsetLoaded`. I\u0027m not sure where a big comment explaining the rest of this would go, though.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/152910/2/polygerrit-ui/app/elements/core/gr-router/gr-router.js#118",
