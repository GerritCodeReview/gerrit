      "message": "As Shawn said in patch set 4 (I\u0027ll add that to the commit message):\n\nYou can\u0027t use .Factory inside of REST API handlers. Stefan and Jonathan mistakenly tried and wasted a few hours on it.\nThere are only 3 callers of .Factory. Its easier to remove this than to keep it around confusing people that are newer to the code base than myself, Dave Borowitz, or yourself.",

I think it might make sense to provide controlFor/validateFor methods in GenericFactory that take Change.Id and do the lookup there.\n\nYou can use the existing Provider\u003cReviewDb\u003e. Calls to that method will still only work when a RequestContext is properly set up (e.g. in the REST API code path), but that\u0027s true of a lot of methods.",
