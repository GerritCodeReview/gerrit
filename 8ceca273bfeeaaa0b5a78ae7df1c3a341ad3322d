I think it might make sense to provide controlFor/validateFor methods in GenericFactory that take Change.Id and do the lookup there.\n\nYou can use the existing Provider\u003cReviewDb\u003e. Calls to that method will still only work when a RequestContext is properly set up (e.g. in the REST API code path), but that\u0027s true of a lot of methods.",
