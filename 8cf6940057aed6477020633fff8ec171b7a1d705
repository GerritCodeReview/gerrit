(People may still have been using the hook, just with the default name. Or, given the text of Iab988b3cf, nobody is even using the hook, only the event.)",

Maybe it is worth pointing out the bugfix in the release notes for 2.12, the those who did not speak up but found out by experimentation or by reading the source may have an easier life. \n\nIf the release notes are generated by just skimming over the git log, maybe it\u0027s worth fixing the bug in a separate commit, such that it gets noticed?",
