It moves every time the user saves a file. Ick.\n\nFor GET on /content yes its cacheable, but I think we will almost _never_ use the SHA-1 of the edit ref changes so often. Instead we would want to use a more abstract identifier and just disable caching.\n\nWhat we should do is use the either the PatchSet.Id (\"4.edit\") or the SHA-1 of the published patch set (\"c0ffee.edit\") as the name of the edit revision.",
