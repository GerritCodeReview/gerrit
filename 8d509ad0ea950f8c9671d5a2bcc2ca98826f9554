      "message": "Restating my understanding of the issue. This old code in MemoryCacheFactory means there is a hard dependency between MemoryCacheFactory and H2CacheFactory. We want to be able to not install the module that binds H2CacheFactory, but leave MemoryFactory alone. This source-level dependency makes that impossible.\n\nIn the near/medium term I would like to move the MemoryCacheFactory into a separate cache/mem package.",
