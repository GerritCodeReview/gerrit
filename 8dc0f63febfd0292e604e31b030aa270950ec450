Also, it is not clear that the link would have the specified behavior.\n\nI would suggest something like:\n[] Reviewed | \u003ca href\u003d\"...\"\u003eReview and continue \u003d\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI am not sure about the precise text, but this makes more. Some other versions that could work:\n\nReview and continue \u003d\u003e\nReviewed \u003d\u003e\nMark as reviewed \u003d\u003e\nReview and next unreviewed \u003d\u003e\n\nOr you could just make part of the text link:\n[] Reviewed \u003ca href\u003d\"...\"\u003eand continue \u003d\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n[] Reviewed \u003ca href\u003d\"...\"\u003eand next unreviewed \u003d\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nI think this is my favorite:\n[] Reviewed \u003ca href\u003d\"...\"\u003eand continue \u003d\u003e\u003c/a\u003e",
