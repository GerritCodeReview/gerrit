      "message": "Yeah, I\u0027m doing exactly that, but with this change backported to 3.5. I had tested with EWAH first when I originally made this improvement on our fork several years ago and RB was significantly better than EWAH, but I don\u0027t remember the details of how I tested it.\n\nSo far I can conclusively say that the on-disk storage size is *much* smaller with RB than with bitsets. A set of 30 kernel repos gives a git_tags cache size of ~550MB with bitsets and only ~115MB with RB.\n\nI\u0027d like to see that same kind of 5x improvement for memory, but I\u0027m not sure of the/a right way to precisely measure the memory difference. If I look at the \u0027memory\u0027 field logged in the sshd_log from a git ls-remote of a very large repo with 1.3M refs (including ~375K tags and ~26.5K other non-skippable refs), using bitsets logs ~230GB of memory and using RB logs ~214GB of memory.\n\nThe other impact I\u0027ve measured (but haven\u0027t repeated enough to feel sure about it) is that there does seem to be a small runtime performance impact to using RB (at least for these large repos).\n\nDo you have better ideas for how to get a representative memory impact with and without this change? My other idea so far is to try and drop the heapLimit to a point that it fails with one and works with the other ðŸ˜‚\n\nI think @prudhvi.alahari@linaro.org had gotten a jmh benchmark based on change 243053 working a while back, but it wasn\u0027t clear if that was an accurate way to measure memory impacts since running servers look a lot different than the benchmark.",
