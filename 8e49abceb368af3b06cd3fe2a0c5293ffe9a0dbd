The line 107 should be modified so it considers the RefRight.ALL value is \"refs/*\" but a RefControl instance to \"refs/*\" would have its refName member value equals to \"refs/\".\n\nSo, the correct code to 107th line would be:\n\n if (!RefRight.ALL.substring(0, RefRight.ALL.length() - 1).equals(getRefName()) \u0026\u0026 getProjectControl().isOwner())",
