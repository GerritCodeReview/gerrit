      "message": "I wonder if this is the right approach for handling ignored changes. Maybe we should just have the ChangeQueryProcessor/ChangeQueryRewriter add the -is:ignored term?\n\nAnother way of looking at it: if a user types an arbitrary query [message:foo owner:bar] into the search box, should it omit ignored changes? If arbitrary searches should return ignored changes, then it\u0027s appropriate to just omit them from dashboard queries, and this change is probably fine as-is. If OTOH all searches should omit ignored changes, then we need a more general approach in the backend.",

      "message": "I agree that that\u0027s worth considering, but I don\u0027t think blocking this change is necessary. I think filing a monorail issue would be more appropriate.\n\nThis change provides an immediate fix for dashboards only. It also closes a critical testing gap for our dashboard configuration. If we want to exclude ignored changes from search results in general, then updating dashboard queries and tests will be trivial to do when we make that change.\n\nI\u0027d also like to consider a similar treatment for WIP changes. Ideally they wouldn\u0027t show up in search results unless a search operator or other option is given that specifically enables their inclusion.",
