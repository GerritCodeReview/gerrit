      "message": "I spent so much time caring about the tests. I think the 3 ignored tests represent some corner case, and I wanted to enable them again after adding all the caches and having the overall picture after the redesign. So my intention was not to immediately tackle them in the next change.\n\nThis change though is required for changing the interface of EditTransformer, because the next follow up change introduces the FileDiffCache which will use it.",
