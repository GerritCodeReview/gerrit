      "message": "I spent so much time caring about the tests. I think the 3 ignored tests represent some corner case, and I wanted to enable them again after adding all the caches and having the overall picture after the redesign. So my intention was not to immediately tackle them in the next change.\n\nThis change though is required for changing the interface of EditTransformer, because the next follow up change introduces the FileDiffCache which will use it.",

      "message": "Basically SGTM, I understand that you don\u0027t want to delay the code for corner cases. I\u0027m just concerned that if we don\u0027t know why those tests fail (and we\u0027ll have to figure that out at some point anyway) we may miss an opportunity in the implementation to handle these corner cases efficiently. WDYT about looking into that so that you can just put a \"TODO: Fix this test by doing X\"?",
