I would prefer the idiom to be:\n\n  ReviewDb db \u003d schemaFactory.open();\n  try {\n  } finally {\n    db.close();\n  }\n\nAs then the Java compiler can promise us the value cannot be null at use sites, and its clear what the scope of the value is.",

      "message": "This is too late.  The call b.toPatchScript on line 160 above is the expensive line.  You need to close the connection before running that line of code.  Which may require a bigger refactoring in order to ensure the database connection can be cleanly closed down before that starts.  Maybe pull all of the database access code into its own method?",
