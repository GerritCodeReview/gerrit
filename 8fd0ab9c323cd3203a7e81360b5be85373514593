      "message": "FYI these names are not unique in the server and therefore shared between test methods. I think this doesn\u0027t matter because your test framework sets preferences and stuff just-in-time. But might be safer/clearer if there are unique accounts.\n\nOTOH you mentioned that creating accounts is slow, though, so maybe this is ok.",

      "message": "I work out some of these issues in https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/108233/, where I commit more strongly to reusing accounts across test methods. When I put together the final consolidation commit, I\u0027ll be accounting for all these non-StagedUsers accounts and making sure they are managed in a consistent fashion that isn\u0027t flaky.\n\nGenerally the only per-account state that impacts tested behavior across tests is the preferred email strategy (which I resorted to resetting between tests).",
