This will actually make the ChangeJson.labelsFor{Open,Closed}Change implementations just call different methods on the ChangeNotes, which is nice, because those methods are disgusting right now.\n\nNow to bikeshed the names. So I had previously considered:\n\n Label: Code-Review\u003d+1 A User ...\n\nbut that would mean there are two ways of parsing the \"Label\" footer. Not technically impossible, but possibly confusing.\n\nAlso, it would be possible to have both:\n\n Label: Code-Review\u003d+1\n Label: Code-Review\u003d+1 A User...\n\nwhere \"A User\" is also the committer on this commit. (Technically, there is even still a race where the permissions can change before setting each of these footers.) This is well-defined in that the former implies a label was assigned by this user, and the latter implies this label was immediately normalized and stamped at submit time. (Imagine a hypothetical /review_and_submit endpoint.) But perhaps confusing.\n\nAlthough clunky, I kind of liked \"Submitted-With\" because it says \"this is the result of the submit rule evaluator.\" I might prefer that in place of \"Approved\"...but I could go either way I think.",

And you want to avoid the ambiguity of parsing two formats for this value. So you want a different name for the normalized labels that the submit rule did not use.\n\nDo we even need to normalize the others at submit time? Normalizing was mostly about trying to save the submit rule results permenantly. If we have that in the Submitted-with field maybe we can just grab the other labels as-is from the history and present them without normalization. We know they were normalized at the time they were stored in the history, so at some point in time it was valid.",

      "message": "+1 Submitted-with (lowercase w)\n\nThe idea of normalizing the others at submit time is essentially to record the input to the submit rule evaluator along with the output. If a user voted +2 on PS1 but then lost permissions and is normalized to +1 when PS2 is submitted, then the submit rule evaluator treated them as +1 when doing its magic, so I feel like that should be recorded somewhere.\n\nThat said it\u0027s still not like we have sufficient information to reproduce the submit rule evaluator results, so maybe this is of limited utility.",
