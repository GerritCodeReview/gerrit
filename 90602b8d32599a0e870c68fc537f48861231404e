      "message": "What is the advantage of having the prolog results? That it mentions only the labels specifically required according to the prolog rules?\n\nRather than storing redundant information it might be nice to figure out just what is the additional information that the submit rule evaluator provides over and above the label information...but I can see where that might be nontrivial to code.\n\nAlso, suggestions for two descriptive footer keys that distinguish these two cases welcome :)",

      "message": "Agreed at this point we should have them separate. This will actually make the ChangeJson.labelsFor{Open,Closed}Change implementations just call different methods on the ChangeNotes, which is nice, because those methods are disgusting right now.\n\nNow to bikeshed the names. So I had previously considered:\n\n Label: Code-Review\u003d+1 A User ...\n\nbut that would mean there are two ways of parsing the \"Label\" footer. Not technically impossible, but possibly confusing.\n\nAlso, it would be possible to have both:\n\n Label: Code-Review\u003d+1\n Label: Code-Review\u003d+1 A User...\n\nwhere \"A User\" is also the committer on this commit. (Technically, there is even still a race where the permissions can change before setting each of these footers.) This is well-defined in that the former implies a label was assigned by this user, and the latter implies this label was immediately normalized and stamped at submit time. (Imagine a hypothetical /review_and_submit endpoint.) But perhaps confusing.\n\nAlthough clunky, I kind of liked \"Submitted-With\" because it says \"this is the result of the submit rule evaluator.\" I might prefer that in place of \"Approved\"...but I could go either way I think.",
