      "message": "Nit: If we returned the successfully executed commands instead of the branches, we could also use the return value for the other handling in ReceiveCommits in lines 749-770. Thus, we would have a more unified handling (e.g. not once using this method and the other time using a differently gathered list of commands.) Of course, it would mean that we have to do the mapping from commands to branches both in ReceiveCommits and MergeOp but that wouldn\u0027t be a lot of effort I think. What do you think?",
