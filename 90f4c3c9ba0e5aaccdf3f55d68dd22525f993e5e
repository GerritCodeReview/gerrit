      "message": "While I do create a new change, CherryPickChange.java does share much code with ReceiveCommits. I tried though to reuse other parts of the code base and refactored MergeOp and MergeUtil to allow me to reuse some of the cherry-pick related code.\n\nI think that perhaps ReceiveCommits could benefit from a larger makeover (and it is certainly something I could help with at some point), but it is outside the scope of this change.\n\nI spent quite some time before starting this change looking at ReceiveCommit and how parts could be reused, but to be honest, I did find that such large changes would be needed to be made to ReceiveCommits that I could not motivate it for this change. ReceiveCommits is a critical part of the code, and work is needed to be done in many but small steps. Everything is nested with very command line specific rejects() and exceptions. Not to talk about the ReceiveCommand stuff. \n\nAnyway. While I doubt I can find much to reuse, I will go back and look at ReceiveCommits and try to lift out some stuff (if possible) to a reusable CommitUtils class.",
