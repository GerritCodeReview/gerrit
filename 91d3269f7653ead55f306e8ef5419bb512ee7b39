      "message": "Just a side note, this code was introduced in change I69c46ab4, in 2016, when NoteDb was still in its infancy. Then improved by adding a cache in change I4bbb9bf82f, again in 2016. Since then a lot has changed (and improved) around the NoteDb, and when the `change_notes` cache is populated. It probably had much bigger impact back then, now it looks more of an exception than a rule, that we\u0027ll benefit any performance improvements from this \"side\" loading `revitionNoteMap`. Instead, with the imported changes mapping we suffer from random unintended changes in the `/meta` branch.",
