So\n\u003e this is probably the wrong place to be providing links to JGit API\n\u003e docs?\n\nAlthough JGit is not in the extension-api jar, the extension-api\ndocumentation references JGit nonetheless [1]. Hence, the java_doc\nof the extension-api is the one that will the JGit doc url in the end.\n\n\n[1] See line 34 of https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/3479786c930a73b5b3156ff10ef448ab75e4375a/gerrit-extension-api/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/extensions/events/GarbageCollectorListener.java#34",
