      "message": "I am sceptical about this change, because it potentially creates confusion about which account is a servicer user. I think looking at group members should be sufficient, but by introducing a magic suffix identifying whether an account is a service user is difficult.\n\nI would prefer the ability to trigger some automatic tasks/events on account creation, so you can explicitly add an account to the service user group when the account is *created*. That might be clearer and easier to understand for admins and users.",
