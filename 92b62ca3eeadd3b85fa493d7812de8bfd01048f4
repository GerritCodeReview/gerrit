Adding the Remote suffix doesn\u0027t seem to provide any value to the reader.\n\nAlso, since remote can have multiple URLs, we may need to support multiple adminUrls too.  E.g. I use a single remote to replicate to 4 different machines by just having 4 different URLs listed.  If I need a different adminUrl, I would prefer to just 4 different adminUrls in the same remote, rather than needing to go create 4 different remotes with 1 URL each.",
