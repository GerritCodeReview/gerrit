We should just read PID from GERRIT_PID before doing this test:\n\n  if test $UID \u003d 0; then\n    PID\u003d`cat \"$GERRIT_PID\"`\n    if test -f /proc/$PID/oom_score_adj; then\n\nAlso, please be consistent about the quoting of the /proc file name.  If you are quoting it in the test argument, we should also quote it on the shell redirection from echo.  Or don\u0027t quote it in either place.  In theory we shouldn\u0027t need to quote since $PID should only contain a numeric.",
