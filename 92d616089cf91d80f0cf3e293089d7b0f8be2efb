      "message": "In oom_adj you can set it to -17, which means never kill but the min value should be more than enough.\n\nThe gerrit i run currently gobbles up 18 gigs of ram due to slow disks - add git to that on a 32 gig machine and you get OOM:s that are pretty nasty. git gc --aggressive --prune can consume up to 10 gigs of ram even with limitations set in place, so this would ensure that the service is running trough it all.\nLets just say that both the changes i uploaded are based on real life problems \u003d)",

We should just read PID from GERRIT_PID before doing this test:\n\n  if test $UID \u003d 0; then\n    PID\u003d`cat \"$GERRIT_PID\"`\n    if test -f /proc/$PID/oom_score_adj; then\n\nAlso, please be consistent about the quoting of the /proc file name.

In theory we shouldn\u0027t need to quote since $PID should only contain a numeric.",
