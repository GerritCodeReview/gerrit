To me, that blurs what the class represents.\n\nI agree :-)\n\nI feel a strong temptation to refactor Change, ChangeData and ChangeNotes but because Change gets indexed as protocol buffer that is a significant amount of work, so can\u0027t do ~now.\n\n\u003e I assume we don\u0027t reindex the change if someone adds a draft comment to it, right?\n\nWe do because you can search for \"has:drafts\" and you get changes where you have pending draft comments. Reindexing used to slow down draft comments creation until we removed the mergability computation",
