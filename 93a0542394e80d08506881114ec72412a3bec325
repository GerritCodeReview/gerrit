      "message": "This is a good suggestion and I will include it in a new patch set.\n\nI was also thinking of refactoring this change slightly so the PluginUser was held by the Plugin and exposed to the plugin\u0027s Guice environment as a singleton. This would remove the need for the replication plugin to create their own InternalUser object with the InternalUser.Factory.\n\nSo I guess wait for the next patch set. :-)",
