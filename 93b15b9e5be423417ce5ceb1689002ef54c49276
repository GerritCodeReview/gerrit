      "message": "This is a race condition. I\u0027m surprised this even works at all.  I think I understand how it works due to how promises are done after regular code, but still, this seems like relying on a browser implementation detail. That or I\u0027m missing something obvious.\n\nWhen getRepos is called, you don\u0027t know when the stub method will be called. I would think it would be called immediately, so before element.filter \u003d \u0027filter\u0027.  Maybe the fact that it returns a promise makes it wait for a setTimeout, but even then I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s guaranteed by the standard.",
