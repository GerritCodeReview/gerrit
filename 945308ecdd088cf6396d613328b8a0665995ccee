      "message": "Every time I have demoed Gerrit to a group folks want to know how Gerrit lets them know new updates are available. Clicking \"refresh/reload\" always leads to a frowny face from the trainee.\n\nI think Google has upped the bar for what people expect from web applications that help them communicate. Thanks GMail. :-)\n\nThe biggest issue with this change is load on servers. I\u0027ve tried to make it as cheap as possible by using If-Modified-Since from browser caches and a 304 Not Modified response early, as soon as the Change record\u0027s updated date is known.\n\nIf we leave it off by default nobody will enable it. Maybe its reasonable to have a config variable to disable the feature, but if its worth doing we should have it on by default.",
