Sorry I think I wasn\u0027t clear.\n\nIn line 137, we loop on modifiedFilesList which are requested for the same two patchsets (current vs. latest approved - line 112), so all the returned files are expected to have the same old/new commit IDs: you could look these up using FileDiffOutput#oldCommitId \u0026 FileDiffOutput#newCommitId of the first entry in the list. Using those commit IDs, you could format the diff only once and pass the formatterResult down to this method.",
