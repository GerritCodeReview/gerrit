      "message": "Thanks for bringing the deprecation process to my attention. I was not planning to submit this change soon. I\u0027m playing around with few entities right now, but we were looking into migrating all entities.\n\nI see that plugins need to be updated if we removed entities from the extensions api. One solution I\u0027m thinking of is to create a separate proto api, e.g. com.google.gerrit.extensions.protoapi (implementation in com.google.gerrit.server.protoapi), migrate gerrit core to use the proto api while leaving the existing api intact for plugins/extensions. We can mark the existing api as deprecated. I\u0027d need to do more digging and check if this is possible.\n\nAddendum: \n1) One problem I\u0027m seeing is that both apis will have parallel implementations which is not good. Ideally we want to have a single implementation with different choice of inputs / outputs.\n2) Or, better, the old api can just wrap the new proto api.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "The main reason for this migration is to let polygerrit access the proto entities directly instead of redefining them, so we\u0027ll have a unified view of them in the frontend and backend. Also hiesel@ can comment on this.\n\nOne option I was also considering is using nano proto [1] to reduce the code changes (e.g. it provides public fields for the generated entities). There is currently no design doc, but I agree we need one given that the scope is larger than what I expected. I\u0027ll keep the change as WIP until then.\n\n[1] https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb",

      "message": "+1 to Nasser\u0027s comment on being more clear in the commit message. One can always be more precise in commit messages :-)\n\nWe discussed this migration in the ESC a while ago [1]. I think the migration for users of the extension API is quite trivial: Method calls .fooBar() instead of field access .fooBar and builders instead of constructors.\n\nYoussef is exploring some more options like nanopb that might further reduce any inconvenience.\n\nThe motivation is roughly (as already outlined):\n1) Let folks who implement services that call Gerrit use at least the entity definitions in any language they desire.\n2) Have immutable objects in the Gerrit code (we pass the API objects around quite a bit and reuse them in the events system, so immutability helps reason about system state and race-free implementation).\n3) The Gerrit FE, BE and docs are 3 places where we redefine entities. FE/BE are written in different languages, so the solution has to be x-platform.\n\nAll of that should come at no cost for users of the REST API and at a tiny cost (as state above) for users of the extension API.\n\nThis isn\u0027t entirely self motivated (though, I am a fan of it anyway). We\u0027ve been hearing consistently that Gerrit is hard to integrate with (recent example [2]). Swagger and other REST frameworks seemed too complex and too much of a change (e.g. with Swagger we could not support our plugin REST API the way we do today). So my thinking was that protocol buffers strike a nice balance between reliving users from the pain of c\u0026p\n\n[1] https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2020-12-01-esc-minutes.html#api-object-migration-pojo---proto\n[2] https://github.com/andygrunwald/go-gerrit/issues/86#issuecomment-779144819",
