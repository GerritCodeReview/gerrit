      "message": "I kind of agree, this is actually why I have chosen full_name and preferred_email as field names for the MemberInfo entity. On the other side I can understand if shorter names are preferred since the AccountInfo entity occurs in many places and having long field names is some kind of overhead. I can push a change that proposes the rename of the fields in AccountInfo, then everybody can say whether he likes it or not.",
