Since this change would benefit other stable releases, I am unsure how to proceed next.\n\u003e \n\u003e Should I use the \"Move change\" feature to move it to the stable-3.1 branch, then what would be the parent commit? Intuitively I would expect the change to then be attached to the head of stable-3.1.\n\nI would recommend using Move change. After you use Move change, then you typically want to click Rebase to ensure it\u0027s based on the tip of the new branch. Moving doesn\u0027t do that automatically (because it could fail if there are conflicts).\n\n\u003e \n\u003e And how would I get it included in the other stable branches and master? Are there routine merges from old stable branches to the newer ones up to master? :]\n\u003e \n\nYes, there are routine merges, so you mostly don\u0027t need to worry about it. You\u0027re welcome to try and upload a merge, but for someone making an isolate change like this, I wouldn\u0027t recommend it. There are likely to be other changes in the merge and it might be tricky to resolve any conflicts.",
