      "message": "I\u0027m confused why this is being called \"Backfill\". Maybe it\u0027s just an english language confusion, do you maybe mean \"Populate\"? Backfill makes me think of a one-time effort to fix data in one source by adding it from another source. Here I think you intend to convert the \u0027starred\u0027 field to an optional ChangeInfo field as a fix that should have been included in change I36c1e2f5. Am I understanding that right?\n\nI\u0027m making a point of this because it affects the naming in the rest of this change, especially the `BACKFILL_STARRED_FIELD` option. I think my understanding above is correct, then you can rename that option to `STARRED` and it will be clearer and more consistent with the other options (like `REVIEWED`).",

      "message": "In PS5 I was doing \u0027n\u0027 calls to RefDatabase#exactRef (once per change) to check if they\u0027re starred. I found another method: RefDatabase#exactRef(String... refs). I adapted the code and used the latter. Please note that the implementation of the new method loops on refs and delegates to #exactRef(String ref) so should make no difference, but I substituted it anyway in case another implementations of the multi-refs method allow optimizations.\n\nRE (this is not very cheap): I previously came across some of our internal traces and a call to `RefDatabase#exact` typically takes few microseconds. In this change we\u0027re also populating this field with a flag (default \u003d false) and on dashboards there are usually around 50 changes, so this should be performant.",
