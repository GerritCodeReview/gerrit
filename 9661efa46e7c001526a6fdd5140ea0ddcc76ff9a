In short, to also change the color of the background behind the long range comment chip on hover to be the same as the long comment range on hover: `--diff-highlight-range-hover-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5);`\n\nThis will make the relationship between the background of the chip and the comment clearer as they will be highlighted similarly on hover.",
