It seems that there very old version 1.6 from October 2013 is used:\n\n  maven_jar(\n    name \u003d \"commons_compress\",\n    artifact \u003d \"org.apache.commons:commons-compress:1.6\",\n    sha1 \u003d \"c7d9b580aff9e9f1998361f16578e63e5c064699\",\n  )\n\nthat coresponds JGit Maven pom.xml:\n\n  \u003ccommons-compress-version\u003e1.6\u003c/commons-compress-version\u003e\n\nIt\u0027s already out of sync today, but still I would prefer to fix it first, and try to update it in JGit first.\n\nBTW: the latest version is 1.15 October, 2017, the one you are upgrading here is from May 2017.",
