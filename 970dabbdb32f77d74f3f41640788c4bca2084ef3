Looking back at prior releases [1][2], doc fixes do tend to get their own bullets. I\u0027d also be ok with some amount of consolidation, like \"Plugin documentation improvements\", but I\u0027ll leave that to the release manager\u0027s discretion.\n\nTried to improve in the next PS.\n\n[1] https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.5.html#documentation-changes\n[2] https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.4.html#documentation-changes",
