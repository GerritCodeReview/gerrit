      "message": "How is this duplicated code?\nHere an example of what I meant:\nIn stable-2.14, we don\u0027t have the notedb, so we don\u0027t test against it. From stable-2.15 onwards however we have so the Jenkinsfile will have an additional build mode added. That would not be duplicated, but just a change with a newer version. We just have to take care of it, when merging this change upwards. The overall structure of the Jenkinsfile will stay the same. I don\u0027t see the issue.\n\nHowever, trying to simplify the Jenkinsfile and use as many standard libraries/Jenkins plugins as possible is certainly a valid goal.",
