      "message": "Current implementation of prompting to enable notifications next to address bar is very distracting. We will use double permission pattern in FE - https://web.dev/push-notifications-permissions-ux/#double_permission\nthat is common pattern and it is less distracting.\n\nWith this setting user will be able to turn off any prompt about enabling notifications.\n\nIf user denies all notification permission, we can turn off prompting. But that depends on user testing.",
