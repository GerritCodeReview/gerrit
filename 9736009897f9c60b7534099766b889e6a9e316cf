      "message": "It wouldn\u0027t be needed even without exporting the dependencies when transitive build dependency option is used. So as a test you can replace exported_deps in deps again in lib/BUCK and keep all junit and guava removed and run:\n\n  $ buck build --build-dependencies\u003dTRANSITIVE \u003crule\u003e\n\nand this would work. So to makes commit message more clear why the exporting is actually needed here, I would add this statement:\n\n  \"Buck, by default, builds java_library targets with first order deps\nonly, so that transitive dependencies don\u0027t considered.\"\n\nas I did in: [1].\n\n* [1] https://github.com/facebook/buck/commit/9d24d650c57458b33adad3027491a01f20b7455e",
