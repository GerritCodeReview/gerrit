The server is perfectly capable of serving files on demand from /plugins/${name}/static/.* from the ZIP file without unpacking.\n\nIs the purpose of unpacking to make it easy to edit the plugin source in place? How practical is that after doing an installation as a ZIP? Maybe you want to support both a directory and a ZIP format for these pure JS plugins?",
