      "message": "This is a very ugly syntax. I would prefer something like:\n\n  label:Code-Review\u003d1 BY user:jsmith\n\nThat means adding a token BY to Query.g to support getting this into the parse tree, and then altering the way the parse tree is handled in QueryBuilder so that the BY operator can connect the label and user/group child nodes together into a meaningful predicate.\n\nCurrently the parser can \"sort of\" grok this:\n\n  label:(Code-Review\u003d1 user:jsmith)\n\nby rewriting this as though you had written:\n\n  label:Code-Review\u003d1 label:user:jsmith\n\nUsing () here to bind these isn\u0027t as easy to use as having a specialized operator \"BY\" that accepts a user/group predicate as a child.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think using BY is a generic enough extensible mechanism.  Imagine trying to tie in the time of the approval also, how would you do it? \n\n   label:Code-Review\u003d1 BY user:jsmith BY time:\"1hour ago\"\n\nHere the second BY doesn\u0027t make linguistic sense, and what would it be joining?\n\nThe \",keyword\u003dvalue\" mechanism is easily extensible to many scenarios (we have already used it on other custom operators of ours).  It is also possible to make it order insensitive.  The BY seems strange and un-intuitive, it pretends to join 2 predicates but it really isn\u0027t; it is just a mechanism to add additional parameters to the first Predicate.",
