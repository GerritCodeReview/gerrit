      "message": "Not sure, but maybe it would be good to support adding of multiple inline commands with just one \u0027gerrit inline\u0027 command?\n\nAs I understand this command is intended to be used from scripts in a CI system, e.g. to comment on findbug issues. In this case it is not unlikely that several inline comments have to be added and it\u0027s always good to minimize the number of requests that have to be send. \n\nWhat do you think?",
