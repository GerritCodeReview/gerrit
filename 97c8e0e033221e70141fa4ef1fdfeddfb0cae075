      "message": "1) ApprovalInference: forPatchSet(ChangeNotes notes, PatchSet.Id psId, @Nullable RevWalk rw, @Nullable Config repoConfig) seems unused\n\n2) ApprovalInference: forPatchSet(\n      ChangeNotes notes, PatchSet ps, @Nullable RevWalk rw, @Nullable Config repoConfig) the RW and Config seem unused because the only caller passes in null?\n\nThis confuses me a bit, though. The code in PatchSetInserter calls dynamicallyComputeCopiedApprovals without passing a RevWalk. Usually, you can only read contents of the current transaction (i.e. the new patch set) when you pass a RevWalk. How can ApprovalInference determine e.g. the change type of the patch set we are currently creating when it doesn\u0027t get that RevWalk?\n\n3) I think this change is missing an important part: Reworking ApprovalInference to only ever attempt to copy from patch set latest-1 to latest when computing dynamic approvals.",
