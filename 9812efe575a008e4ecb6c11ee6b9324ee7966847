The ActionInfo was certainly written in 2013 and the new file its being put into were created in 2013.\n\nThe 2012 date refers to the ChangeInfo you copied it out of, which is \"ancient\" code.\n\nIn general we just slap the current year in the header for a new file. We rarely back date it unless the file is a rename of the overwhelming file content.",

      "message": "nit: these blank lines between methods are often omitted in JSNI glue code like this class.\n\nThe rule is if it extends JavaScriptObject and uses native methods as simple getters or setters to access the fields in JavaScript and the JSNI code all fits on one line with the method declaration as shown here, we skip the blank line between methods.",
