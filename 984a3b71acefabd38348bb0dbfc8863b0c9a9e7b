      "message": "Let\u0027s try to explain it with a usecase: In Gerrit 2.10 the endpoint \u0027/config/server/tasks/{task-id}\u0027 got added. If the client requests this from a server \u003c 2.10 a 404 is returned. If a client requests this from a server \u003e\u003d 2.10 with an invalid task-id he also gets a 404 status code. Though the cause of this errors are completely different. A cleanly implemented REST client would return a NotImplementedException in the first case in order to inform the user that this operation is not supported. In the second case, he should inform the user that the task with the provided id is not available. Without this version header, an additional call is required in the error handling code (even when the response is cached, there is at least one call necessary).",

      "message": "Ok, good point with the 404 differences between unsupported and not found.\n\nIs that the primary motivation? Maybe the RestApiServlet should return an extended header to let the caller know the operation is not supported?\n\nFor example we have the REST API add:\n\n  X-Gerrit-Error: unsupported-operation\n\nanytime a view implementation cannot be found to support the request. This would cover both 404 Not Found being confusing as well as 405 Invalid Method when a client tries to POST to a resource that exists but is not editable in that version of the Gerrit server or in its current resource state.\n\nPresence of the \"X-Gerrit-Error: unsupported-operation\" header would be a clear signal to the client the version doesn\u0027t do what they are trying. Client libraries should not need to maintain a table of supported APIs vs. server features to implement clean error handling.\n\nThat sort of thing should be a straightforward patch to RestApiServlet that could applied in an older shipping version if we wanted to push a 2.9.5 and 2.10.1 with it. Most of that part of RestApiServlet has been stable for years.",

      "message": "\u003e\u003e Is that the primary motivation?\nYes, but I think there could be also other situations where the client should know what version the server has as long as the REST API is not versioned. I have not run in such an usecase yet, but for example the \u0027kind\u0027 attribute got removed in 2.10 (I know this is not the best example and I have not tested what happens when a client would send it to a 2.10 server). But I think there could be more situation where such an information would be useful.\n\n\n\u003e\u003e Presence of the \"X-Gerrit-Error: unsupported-operation\" header would be a clear signal to the client the version doesn\u0027t do what they are trying.\nI think this a good idea. I have shortly looked into this code, but I think a new exception would be required. \u0027ResourceNotFoundException\u0027 is thrown in in both cases (view not found and resource not available) in many places. Probably I have just missed the \"right\" place?",
