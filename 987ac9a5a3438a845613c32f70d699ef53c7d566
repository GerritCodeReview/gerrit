This is because that particular configuration is mostly interesting for development, and this quick guide doesn\u0027t cover how to set up the development environment around gerrit.\n\nIf we have or make a similar document how to quickly startup gerrit development, I think this mode should be mentioned.\n\nPlease let me know if you do not agree, or have other feedback. Thanks!",

      "message": "I don\u0027t like introducing too many options in a quick and dirty startup documentation like this, but I agree that the --empty-commit also can be a problem if the user already has a project to try out with.\n\nSo I think it\u0027s a valid concern. I\u0027ll try to make two ways to run this command, one way with no pre-existing project, and one way with a pre-existing git that you want to use for testnig and another way with no previous git, starting from zero.\n\nThanks for your feedback, patch set coming!",
