      "message": "Maybe side-effects was the wrong word.\n\nI know we are trying to not just pass one huge object around, instead choosing to explicitly pass to child elements the pieces of the object that we need. It looks like, in this case, all that was needed in addition here was `change.labels`. Is there a reason you chose to refactor the element in this way, as opposed to just adding a label property?",

This element is mainly just a bunch of things that key off the change object, so it still makes sense to me to just pass that in.\n\nAt any rate, you\u0027re right that adding a labels property is simple, so I did that.",
