With previous design where you\u0027ve populated the mergeable data from the database in persistent H2 cache this wasn\u0027t strictly necessary.",

There have already been 2 index schema changes since 2.10, so this will trigger for anybody upgrading from 2.10 to a later stable version.\n\n(People running a dev version who have already upgraded to v13 will have to run --recheck-mergeable manually. We could in theory trigger an online reindex of the same schema version in this case, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth putting significant effort into.)",
