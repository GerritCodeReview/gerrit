      "message": "OK, now i see the reason for your original version: follow-up change where you are loading the revision actions from dedicated endpoint and GET /changes/\u003cid\u003e/detail wouldn\u0027t return actions in revision info anyway, because CURRENT_ACTIONS is replaced with CHANGE_ACTIONS in the endpoint invocation. There are two problems here: For one you did this change in the wrong change (and you forgot to do it again in the right change after this was reverted). For another: why to call it from here, at all, when it is called from onSuccess() method of new GET actions endpoint?",
