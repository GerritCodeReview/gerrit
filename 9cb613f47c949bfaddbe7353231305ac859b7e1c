      "message": "I see why you did this. But I wonder if we could do something that is more clear to users. The first thing that comes to mind is to use ^ instead of -, since in git the way to refer to \"second parent of commit X\" is \"X^2\". So your example would be \"^1..2\". Or maybe we require the patch set number prior to the ^, i.e. \"2^2..2\". In theory this would also allow such things as \"1^2..4\" to compare against the first parent of patch set 1. (Not that I can see why anybody would want to do that, honestly :)",
