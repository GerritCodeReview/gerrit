      "message": "It would be possible, but that would mean that users can set either the range property, or the four individual ones. My concern with the individual ones is that a compiler cannot enforce that all of none of them are set - which is the behavior I want. The other concern is that this widget is used in a couple of places outside gr-diff, and I am trying to change it as little as possible. Does that make sense? Or do you still think reflected properties are better? See a similar conversation I had with Kasper - we decided to use a comment at the top to document that this attributes exist.",
