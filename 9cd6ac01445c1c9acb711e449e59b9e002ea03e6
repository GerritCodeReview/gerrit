Am I missing something? Could you elaborate on that question?\n\nMaybe I\u0027m missing the purpose of this router feature.

So, presumably, once the edit has been created, I\u0027d only want to be navigating to `/c/p/+/123/edit`.\n\nIs that different from what happens when navigating to ,edit?\n\nIt\u0027s also not clear to me why opening a revision for edit needs to be a route/URL? Can creating an edit based on some revision be a button?",
