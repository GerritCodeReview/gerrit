This patch is applied to a gerrit image at [1]\n\nThis image is then run in test [2] against a mariadb container.  I can\u0027t see anything in the logs that says the connection is successful but the gerrit logs are at [3] and it was failing without this.\n\nThe overall change is [4], which is converting our testing to use a mariadb container instead of H2, which is how I came across this.\n\n[1] https://zuul.opendev.org/t/openstack/build/ae4418094fd247f88d70ad6ed59a4ebd/console#5/0/1/ubuntu-bionic\n[2] https://zuul.opendev.org/t/openstack/build/7625b0ddf0864056b49737b35433ea59\n[3] https://f7a59a81b5009ca87340-4b3f718c770950e32a7b9dcba0bdae3a.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/775961/12/check/system-config-run-review-3.2/7625b0d/review01.openstack.org/logs/\n[4] https://review.opendev.org/c/opendev/system-config/+/775961\n",
