If the commits are not supposed to be submitted out-of-order then why use the Cherry-Pick submit strategy? Wouldn\u0027t then the Merge-if-Necessary or the Rebase-if-Necessary be more suitable?",

      "message": "Rebase-If-Necessary is relatively new (2.6), I wasn\u0027t aware of it.\n\nStill, I\u0027m not sure it fits our needs.\n\nWe usually do push unrelated changes without dependencies, but it happens occasionally that a change needs to be submitted out of order.\n\nOther advantages of the Cherry-Pick strategy are that it updates the committer details (name/email and date) according to the user that submits the change, and adds the Reviewed-by footers.\n\nSubmitting a commit out of order *is* an option, but it should rarely be used in practice, and IMO it doesn\u0027t worth notifying the user of a \"problem\", which distracts from real conflicts.\n\nA few devs contacted me asking why does it show \"Merge Conflict\" for a change that was just pushed. It happened in practice, not in theory.",

      "message": "The information on the change screen tells if this commit with the displayed merge strategy is mergeable. In that sense it tells the truth even for the Cherry-Pick strategy.\n\nI understand what you want to achieve but I am not sure that this justifies providing a potentially incorrect information (according to the definition of cherry-pick).\n\nMaybe a better option is to provide what you need as a plugin and show the additional info as \"mergeable if cherry-picked in commit order\"?",
