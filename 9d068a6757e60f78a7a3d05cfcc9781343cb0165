If the commits are not supposed to be submitted out-of-order then why use the Cherry-Pick submit strategy? Wouldn\u0027t then the Merge-if-Necessary or the Rebase-if-Necessary be more suitable?",

      "message": "The information on the change screen tells if this commit with the displayed merge strategy is mergeable. In that sense it tells the truth even for the Cherry-Pick strategy.\n\nI understand what you want to achieve but I am not sure that this justifies providing a potentially incorrect information (according to the definition of cherry-pick).\n\nMaybe a better option is to provide what you need as a plugin and show the additional info as \"mergeable if cherry-picked in commit order\"?",
