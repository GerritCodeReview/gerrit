      "message": "Would be good to comment about thread safety here.\n\nI think this is safe as you operate on one ChangeData per thread only, so it doesn\u0027t matter that CD is not thread safe.\n\nFor us at Google I am not sure if this will give us much. We are caching the open repo per thread, which we loose when parallelizing here. So for operations that actually need to load from the repo, we have to load pack infos once per CD now. Still interesting to try and see, though.",
