      "message": "This is not how it works. move() only considers one single JAR file even if multiple matches exist. That\u0027s because it handles only the first key:\n\n  String first \u003d matches.firstKey();\n\nSo that in fact, for guice- there are multiple matches (but only if you add \"/\" in front of \"guice-\": like this \"/guice-\"): [1], but only the first guice- is considered, in this case, only:\n\n  /guice-4.2.0.jar\n\nSo that the current code is correct, that it invoked twice move for different prefixes even if the start from the common prefix. Still, that code is a no op, see other comments.\n\n* [1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/718980",
