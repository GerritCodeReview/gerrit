It hasn\u0027t been backported to stable-2.10 and stable-2.11 because there were some issues with it that had to be fixed in follow-up changes [2, 3] and there is still a bug with it that has a fix up for review [4].\n\nThe workaround is to nuke the buck-out and cache folders before making the release build.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/67043/\n[2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/67080\n[3] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/67101\n[4] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/67186/",
