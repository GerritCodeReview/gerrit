All but one of the callers of validCommits were in the codepath where it\u0027s processing a refs/for/* command, and we fail fast if more than one such command is present in the batch.\n\nThe remaining caller was when auto-closing changes. So you would have to push both refs/for/foo and refs/heads/bar in the same push.",
