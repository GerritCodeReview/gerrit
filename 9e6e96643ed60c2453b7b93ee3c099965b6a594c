      "message": "Extracting KeyType from H2CacheImpl is a good idea in my opinion as well as the other improvements you did in the follow-up changes to it. Given the end of the series (currently I7f2e56f78), I don\u0027t think we should have a common type for key and value when we have the serializers. With them, it\u0027s kind of strange that StringEntryKeyImpl and ObjectEntryKeyImpl both just pass through to an arbitrary value serializer. I think it would be better to hold the value serializer directly in H2CacheImpl.\n\nIf it\u0027s easier for the refactoring to first separate out the value type as well, I\u0027m fine with having it as an intermediate version.",

      "message": "Just so I understand your suggestion...do you think we should keep KeyType as a simple container for the columnType and funnel fields? (Just in its own file and properly singleton-ified.)\n\nBeyond that, yeah, I see your point. The main thing having all these EntryType methods is buying is not needing so many fields in the SqlStore class, but that\u0027s not a great argument for keeping it, especially given the awkwardness you\u0027ve pointed out.",
