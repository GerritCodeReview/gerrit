I also considered to add a label here:\n\n  \"Publish Edit as: \" \n\nfollowing by two buttons\n\n  \"Regular Patch Set\" | \"Draft Patch Set\"\n\nI also considered to rename \"Publish Draft\" button to \"Publish Draft ...\" and offer a popup dialog when it\u0027s clicked and render the checkbox: \"Publish as draft patch set\" that would be unchecked per default.\n\nI\u0027m not sure that a user option is right thing here, because it\u0027s something that should be easy changed per change edit base.",
