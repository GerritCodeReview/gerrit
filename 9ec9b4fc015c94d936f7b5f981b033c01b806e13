      "message": "I removed this statement. But here the explanation.\n\nI meant changing commit message. Prior to inline edit feature, there was a dedicated button, called \"Edit Message\". One click on this button, change the text, click on save, done. With change edit workflow, this button was removed in this change: [1] and users are forced to use change edit workflow now, to change the commit message as well.\n\nWe are getting a lot of complains: users want One-Click-\"Edit Message\"-Buton workflow back. And don\u0027t want to mess around with inlie edit feature altogther to change commit message only.\n\nIronically, before [1] was merged, I uploaded the same change: [2] to remove \"Change Edit\" button from the change screen, but this removal change was rejected by other reviewers with excatly this argument: changing commit message workflow would be unnecessary complicated if it\u0027s done in context of inline edit feature (only).\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/63111\n* [2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/61114",
