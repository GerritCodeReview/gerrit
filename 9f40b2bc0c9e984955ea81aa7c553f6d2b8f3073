      "message": "Cool that it\u0027s now possible to undo the deletion of a merge strategy.\n\n[optional] Just one small thing, I think that the formatting of the deleted line can be improved a bit. At the moment you highlight a deleted line by applying the \u0027deletedMergeStrategy\u0027 css style. That\u0027s good, but the content of the line stays unchanged. Looking at the access rights table I see, that for a deleted line the content of the line actually changes, e.g. if you delete a reference the deleted line will show the text \u0027Reference refs/heads/* was deleted\u0027 instead of the original content. Would something similar be possible here? E.g. would it be possible to display \u0027Merge strategy for refs/foo/* was deleted\u0027? I\u0027m not sure how difficult that would be, if it\u0027s too difficult, just ignore this idea.",

      "message": "Hi Edwin,\n\nInitially I tried to do this way, but since this is a table, it is difficult to merge cells of single rows and manage the content of the rows without removing and adding lines, or making it invisible. The UI was not so good and I was wasting a lot of time on this.\n\nSince this is optional for you, I will ignore this modification and do as you said in line 190.",
