      "message": "Oops this was testing from February 10. There was a small issue running the tests today that I think has been corrected (unrelated to this fix) and the jobs have been enqueued again. I\u0027ll report back with updated logs from our downstream testing once that is done.\n\nI don\u0027t expect problems though considering the previous patchsets worked. This should work too as it was just a small refactoring.",

I\u0027m not sure if it is safe to change that one to be private (I think plugins could be consuming it?). stable-3.3 does build if I change both to private though.\n\nI\u0027ll defer to you on whether or not changing getTransitiveMembers to private and/or getDirectMembers is appropriate.",
