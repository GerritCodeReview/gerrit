I think it is a good idea to have Marian\u0027s opinion before doing anything else.\n\nGiving it another thought, I think that \u0027RELATION\u0027 might be a bit of an overkill, I personally would be annoyed by having to type \u003e\u003c\u003d operators + could add complexity for sorting.\n\nI looked at what Critique is doing, and I think it makes a bit more sense:\n\n1) By default, for submitted CLs, it searches by the submitted date, for pending CLs it searches by created date.\n2) It always sorts on the last update\n3) When passing modifier timespec:lc, it searches by the last comment time (I think it could be last update modifier in our case, I don\u0027t see much of a difference)\n\nI think it should not be too much work, but we would also need to index on createdOn date",
