      "message": "@hanwen@google.com in addition to hopefully checking this for LC, I think you\u0027re the only one who has reviewed anything in TagSet in recent memory. We\u0027ve been running a version of this on 2.7 for 4 years now and had been hoping to have an even more optimal solution when we moved to 3.5, but we don\u0027t have that yet, so I think we at least need this.\n\nWithout this change we have some repos that have so many non-change/non-tag refs that we get exceptions in H2 trying to store them into the disk cache and there\u0027s almost 1GB of heap being used just for the TagSet. I don\u0027t have the new usage # yet with this change backported to 3.5, but we know from our 2.7 production usage that it\u0027s significantly less.",
