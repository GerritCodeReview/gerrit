The table is simply huge for a server that is managing Android.\n\nWhat about instead adding a button to the right of the nameBox called \"Browse ...\" that opens up a popup containing the project list.  Then the user can browse in the popup, make a selection, and have the popup dismiss, filling in the name?\n\nSimilar to the \u0027f\u0027 shortcut when reviewing files, but actually fill the screen rather than only the lower half.",
