NAME
----
gerrit abandon - Abandon a change

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit abandon'
  [--message <MESSAGE>]
  PROJECT,BRANCH,CHANGEID

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Abandons a change, sending out email notifications and updating
the database.

Patch sets should be specified as complete or abbreviated commit
SHA-1s.  If the same commit is available in multiple projects the
--project option may be used to limit where Gerrit searches for
the change to only the contents of the specified project.

For current backward compatibility with user tools patch sets may
also be specified in the legacy 'CHANGEID,PATCHSET' format, such as
'8242,2'.  Support for this legacy format is planned to be removed
in a future edition of Gerrit Code Review.  Use of commit SHA-1s
is strongly encouraged.

OPTIONS
-------

--message::
-m::
	Optional cover letter to include as part of the message
	sent to reviewers when the approval states are updated.

+
Used by some scripts/CI-systems, where the results (or links
to the result) are posted as a message after completion of a
build (often together with a label-change, indicating the success
of the build).
+
If the change is abandoned successfully, the cmd will return
successfully, even if the label could not be changed.

--help::
-h::
	Display site-specific usage information, including the
	complete listing of supported approval categories and values.

ACCESS
------
Any user who has configured an SSH key.

SCRIPTING
---------
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

EXAMPLES
--------

Abandon the change with Change-Id Ic0ff33 in project my/project in branch master:
=====
	$ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit abandon my/project,master,Ic0ff33
=====

Append the message "Change is obsolete". Notice two levels of quoting is
required, one for the local shell, and another for the argument parser
inside the Gerrit server:
=====
	$ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit abandon -m '"Change is obsolete"' my/project,master,Ic0ff33
=====
