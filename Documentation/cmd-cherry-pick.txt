= gerrit-cherry-pick

== NAME
gerrit-cherry-pick - Download and cherry pick one or more changes

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
--
_gerrit-cherry-pick_ <remote> <changeid>...
_gerrit-cherry-pick_ --continue | --skip | --abort
_gerrit-cherry-pick_ --close <remote>
--

== DESCRIPTION
Downloads the listed changes specified on the command line and
proceeds to cherry-pick them (rewriting commit SHA-1s as it goes)
onto the current branch.

If a merge failure prevents this from being completely automatic,
you will be asked to resolve the conflict and restart the command
with the `--continue` option.

Change ids may be specified as either the change id (e.g. 1234)
or as change id slash patch set number (e.g. 1234/8).  If the patch
set number is not supplied, `/1` is assumed.

The `--close` command line option is now deprecated, as closing
existing changes post cherry-pick is better handled simply by
ensuring link:user-changeid.html[Change-Id lines] are present in
each commit message.
