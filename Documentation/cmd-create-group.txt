gerrit create-group
===================

NAME
----
gerrit create-group - Create a new account group.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit create-group' \
[\--owner <GROUP>] \
[\--description <DESC>] \
[\--member <USERNAME>] \
[\--group <GROUP>] \
<GROUP>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a new account group.  The group creating user (the user that
fired the create-group command) is not automatically added to
the created group.  In case the creating user wants to be a member of
the group he/she must list itself in the --member option.  This is
slightly different from Gerrit's Web UI where the creating user automatically
becomes a member of the newly created group.

ACCESS
------
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group.

SCRIPTING
---------
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

OPTIONS
-------
<GROUP>::
	Required; name of the new group.

\--owner, -o::
	Name of the owning group. If not specified the group will be self-owning.

\--description, -d::
	Description of group.
+
Description values containing spaces should be quoted in single quotes
(\').  This most likely requires double quoting the value, for example
`\--description "\'A description string\'"`.

\--member::
	User name to become initial member of the group.  Multiple \--member
	options may be specified to add more initial members.

\--group::
	Group name to include in the group.  Multiple \--group options may
	be specified to include more initial groups.

EXAMPLES
--------
Create a new account group called `gerritdev` with two initial members
`developer1` and `developer2`.  The group should be owned by itself:

====
	$ ssh -p 29418 user@review.example.com gerrit create-group --member developer1 --member developer2 gerritdev
====

Create a new account group called `Foo` owned by the `Foo-admin` group.
Put `developer1` as the initial member and include group description:

====
	$ ssh -p 29418 user@review.example.com gerrit create-group --owner Foo-admin --member developer1 --description "'Foo description'" Foo
====

Note that it is necessary to quote the description twice.  The local
shell needs double quotes around the value to ensure the single quotes
are passed through SSH as-is to the remote Gerrit server, which uses
the single quotes to delimit the value.
