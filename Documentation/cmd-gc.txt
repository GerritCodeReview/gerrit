NAME
----
gerrit gc - Run the Git garbage collection

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit gc'
  [--all]
  <NAME> ...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Runs the Git garbage collection for the specified projects.

A Gerrit system administrator can define the default parameters that
should be used for running the garbage collection in the user global
Git configuration file of the system user that runs the Gerrit
server.

Since the user global Git configuration file is overlaid with the Git
configuration on repository level it is possible to specify
repository specific parameters for the garbage collection in the Git
repository configuration of every project.

Garbage collection is an expensive operation and running the garbage
collection should be planned with care.  Especially it should be
ensured to not run the garbage collection in parallel multiple times
on the same repository.  Running the garbage collection in parallel
multiple times on the same repository does not make sense, but it's
not prevented by Gerrit.

ACCESS
------
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group,
or have been granted the 'Run Garbage Collection' global capability.

This command is intended to be used in scripts.
