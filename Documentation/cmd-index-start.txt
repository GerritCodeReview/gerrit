= gerrit index start

== NAME
gerrit index start - Start the online indexer

== SYNOPSIS
--
'ssh' -p @SSH_PORT@ @SSH_HOST@ 'gerrit index start'
--

== DESCRIPTION
Gerrit supports online index schema upgrades. When starting Gerrit for the first
time after an upgrade that requires an index schema upgrade, the online indexer
will be started. If the schema upgrade is a success, the new index will be
activated and if it fails, a statement in the logs will be printed with the
number of successfully/failed indexed changes.

This command allows restarting the online indexer without having to restart
Gerrit. This command will not start the indexer if it is already running or if
the active index is the latest.

== ACCESS
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group.

== SCRIPTING
This command is intended to be used in scripts.
