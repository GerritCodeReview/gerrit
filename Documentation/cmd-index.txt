Gerrit2 - Command Line Tool
===========================

Client Commands
---------------

Client commands can be downloaded via scp, and then executed on
the client system.

link:cmd-cherry-pick.html[gerrit-cherry-pick]::
  Download and cherry-pick one or more changes (commits).

To download a client command, use scp:

  $ scp -P 29418 review.example.com:bin/gerrit-cherry-pick ~/bin


Executing Commands
------------------

Aside from the standard Git server side actions, Gerrit supports
several other commands over its internal SSH daemon.  As Gerrit does
not provide an interactive shell, the commands must be triggered
from an ssh client, for example:

  $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit ls-projects

For more details on how to determine the correct SSH port number,
see link:user-upload.html#test_ssh[Testing Your SSH Connection].
