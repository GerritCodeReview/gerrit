gerrit inline
==============

NAME
----
gerrit inline - Add inline comment

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit inline' [\--project <PROJECT>] [\--left] {COMMIT | CHANGEID,PATCHSET} PATH LINENUMBER MESSAGE

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Patch sets should be specified as complete or abbreviated commit
SHA-1s.  If the same commit is available in multiple projects the
\--project option may be used to limit where Gerrit searches for
the change to only the contents of the specified project.

For current backward compatibility with user tools patch sets may
also be specified in the legacy 'CHANGEID,PATCHSET' format, such as
'8242,2'.  Support for this legacy format is planned to be removed
in a future edition of Gerrit Code Review.  Use of commit SHA-1s
is strongly encouraged.

PATH and LINENUMBER arguments tells Gerrit the file where the MESSAGE should be added.

OPTIONS
-------

\--project::
-p::
	Name of the project the intended changes are contained
	within.  This option must be supplied before the commit
	SHA-1 in order to take effect.
