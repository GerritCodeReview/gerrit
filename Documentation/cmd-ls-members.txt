=================

NAME
----
gerrit ls-members - List the members of a group

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit ls-members'
  [--recursive | -r]
  [--verbose | -v]
  <GROUP>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Displays the members of a group, if the group is visible to the calling
user.

ACCESS
------
Any user who has configured an SSH key.

SCRIPTING
---------
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

All non-printable characters (ASCII value 31 or less) are escaped
according to the conventions used in languages like C, Python, and Perl,
employing standard sequences like `\n` and `\t`, and `\xNN` for all
others. In shell scripts, the `printf` command can be used to unescape
the output.

If a member has no full name set the anonymous coward name is printed
out for this user.

OPTIONS
-------
<GROUP>::
	Required; name of the group for which the members should be listed.

--recursive::
-r::
	If specified the included groups will be resolved recursively. The
	command then outputs a flat list with the contained members. The
	flat list contains all members that are either direct or indirect
	members of the specified group, but from the flat list it is
	impossible to discern specifically whether they are direct or
	indirect members.

--verbose::
-v::
	Enable verbose output with tab-separated columns for the
	full name, account id, username, and preferred email.

EXAMPLES
--------

List all members of group 'MyGroup':
=====
	$ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit ls-members -r MyGroup
	Jane Roe
	John Doe
	Richard Roe
=====
