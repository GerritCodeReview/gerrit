	Branch for which the command will display the sha of each project.
	The command may have multiple --show-branch parameters, in this case
	sha will be shown for each of the branches.
	If the user does not have READ access to some branch or the branch does not
	exist then stub (40 `-` symbols) is shown.
	If the user does not have access to any branch in the project then the
	whole project is not shown.

--tree::
-t::
	Displays project inheritance in a tree-like format.
	This option does not work together with the show-branch option.

	Display only projects of the specified type.  If not
	specified, defaults to `code`. Supported types:
