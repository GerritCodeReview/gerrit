== NAME
gerrit ls-user-refs - List refs visible to a specific user.

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
--
_ssh_ -p <port> <host> _gerrit ls-user-refs_
  [--project PROJECT> | -p <PROJECT>]
  [--user <USER> | -u <USER>]
  [--only-refs-heads]
--

== DESCRIPTION
Displays all refs that the specified user can see.

Allows an administrator to query which refs are visible for
a user. The command is helpful for admins when debugging why a
user cannot access certain refs and also to help admins
verify that certain secret refs are not exposed to the wrong
groups.

== ACCESS
Administrators

== OPTIONS
--project::
-p::
	Required; Name of the project for which the refs should be listed.

--user::
-u::
	Required; User for which the visible refs should be listed. Gerrit
	will query the index to find matching users, so the full
	identity/name does not need to be specified.

--only-refs-heads::
	Only list the refs found under refs/heads/*

== EXAMPLES

List visible refs for the user "mr.developer" in project "gerrit"
