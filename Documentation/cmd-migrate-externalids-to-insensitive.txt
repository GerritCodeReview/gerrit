== NAME
gerrit migrate-externalids-to-insensitive - Migrate external-ids to case insensitive.

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
--
_ssh_ -p <port> <host> _gerrit migrate-externalids-to-insensitive_
--

== DESCRIPTION
This command allows to trigger online conversion of `username` and
`gerrit` external IDs to be handled case insensitively. This is done by
recomputing the name of the note from the sha1 sum of the all lowercase
external ID key, instead of preserving the key capitalization.

The command requires link:#auth.userNameCaseInsensitive[auth.userNameCaseInsensitive] and
link:#auth.userNameCaseInsensitiveMigrationMode[auth.userNameCaseInsensitiveMigrationMode] to
be set to true to perform the migration.

After the successful migration
link:#auth.userNameCaseInsensitiveMigrationMode[auth.userNameCaseInsensitiveMigrationMode] is
set to false.

== ACCESS
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group.

== SCRIPTING
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

== EXAMPLES
Start the online external ids migration:
