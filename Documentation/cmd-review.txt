== DESCRIPTION
Updates the current user's approval status of the specified patch
sets and/or submits them for merging, sending out email
notifications and updating the database.

Patch sets may be specified in 'CHANGEID,PATCHSET' format, such as
'8242,2', or 'COMMIT' format.

If a patch set is specified with the 'COMMIT' format, the complete
or abbreviated commit SHA-1 may be used.  If the same commit is available
in multiple projects the `--project` option may be used to limit where
Gerrit searches for the change to only the contents of the specified project.
If the same commit is available in multiple branches the `--branch` option
may be used to limit where Gerrit searches for changes to only the specified
branch.

	for further details.  These options are only available for the
	labels that are defined in the 'All-Projects' root project and
	that are valid for all projects; for other labels, see --label.
	Votes that are not permitted for the user are silently ignored.

--label::
	Set a label by name to the value 'N'.  Invalid votes (invalid label
	or invalid value) and votes that are not permitted for the user are
	silently ignored.

--strict-labels::
	Require ability to vote on all specified labels before reviewing change.
	If the vote is invalid (invalid label or invalid name), the vote is not
	permitted for the user, or the vote is on an outdated or closed patch set,
	return an error instead of silently discarding the vote.

--tag::
-t::
  Apply a 'TAG' to the change message, votes, and inline comments. The 'TAG'
  can represent an external system like CI that does automated verification
  of the change. Comments with specific 'TAG' values can be filtered out in
  the web UI.
  Note that to apply different tags on on different votes/comments, multiple
  invocations of the SSH command are required.

== EXAMPLES

Approve the change with commit c0ff33 as "Verified +1"
----
	$ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit review --verified +1 c0ff33
----

Vote on the project specific label "mylabel":
----
	$ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit review --label mylabel=+1 c0ff33
----

Append the message "Build Successful". Notice two levels of quoting is
required, one for the local shell, and another for the argument parser
inside the Gerrit server:
----
	$ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit review -m '"Build Successful"' c0ff33
----

Mark the unmerged commits both "Verified +1" and "Code-Review +2" and
submit them for merging:
----
  $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit review \
    --verified +1 \
    --code-review +2 \
    --submit \
    --project this/project \
    $(git rev-list origin/master..HEAD)
----

----
  $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit review --abandon c0ff33
----
