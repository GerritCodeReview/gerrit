NAME
----
gerrit review - Verify, approve and/or submit one or more patch sets

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit approve' [\--project <PROJECT>] [\--message <MESSAGE>] [\--verified <N>] [\--code-review <N>] [\--abandon] [\--restore] [\--submit]  {COMMIT | CHANGEID,PATCHSET}...
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit review' [\--project <PROJECT>] [\--message <MESSAGE>] [\--verified <N>] [\--code-review <N>] [\--abandon] [\--restore] [\--submit]  {COMMIT | CHANGEID,PATCHSET}...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Updates the current user's approval status of the specified patch
sets and/or submits them for merging, sending out email
notifications and updating the database.

Patch sets should be specified as complete or abbreviated commit
SHA-1s.  If the same commit is available in multiple projects the
\--project option may be used to limit where Gerrit searches for
the change to only the contents of the specified project.

For current backward compatibility with user tools patch sets may
also be specified in the legacy 'CHANGEID,PATCHSET' format, such as
'8242,2'.  Support for this legacy format is planned to be removed
in a future edition of Gerrit Code Review.  Use of commit SHA-1s
is strongly encouraged.

OPTIONS
-------

\--project::
-p::
	Name of the project the intended changes are contained
	within.  This option must be supplied before the commit
	SHA-1 in order to take effect.

\--message::

	Optional cover letter to include as part of the message
	sent to reviewers when the approval states are updated.

\--help::

\--code-review::
\--verified::
	Set the approval category to the value 'N'.  The exact
	option names supported and the range of values permitted
	differs per site, check the output of \--help, or contact
	your site administrator for further details.
