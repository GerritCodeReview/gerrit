== DESCRIPTION
Gerrit maintains the generation of the next available sequence numbers for
account, group and change entities. The sequences are stored as UTF-8 text in
a blob pointed to by the `refs/sequences/accounts`, `refs/sequences/groups`
and `refs/sequences/changes` refs. Those refs are stored in `All-Users` and
`All-Projects` git repositories correspondingly.

This command allows to set a new sequence value for those sequences.

The link:cmd-sequence-show.html[sequence-show] command displays current
sequence value.

== ACCESS
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group.

== SCRIPTING
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

== OPTIONS
<NAME>::
  Sequence name to set a new value for.
  Currently supported values:

== EXAMPLES

----
$ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit sequence set changes 42
New value: 42 for sequence: changes was set
