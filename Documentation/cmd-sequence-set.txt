== NAME
gerrit sequence set - Set new sequence value.

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]

_ssh_ -p <port> <host> _gerrit sequence set_ <NAME> <PROJECT> <VALUE>

== DESCRIPTION
Gerrit maintains the generation of the next available sequence numbers for
account, group and change entities. The sequences are stored as UTF-8 text in
a blob pointed to by the `refs/sequences/accounts`, `refs/sequences/groups`
and `refs/sequences/changes` refs. Those first two refs are stored in `All-Users` git repository and
 the last one is kept within the respective project.

This command allows to set a new sequence value for those sequences.

The link:cmd-sequence-show.html[sequence-show] command displays current
sequence value.

== ACCESS
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group.

== SCRIPTING
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

  Currently supported values:
