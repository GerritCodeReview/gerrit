== DESCRIPTION
Gerrit maintains the generation of the next available sequence numbers for
account, group and change entities. The sequences are stored as UTF-8 text in
a blob pointed to by the `refs/sequences/accounts`, `refs/sequences/groups`
and `refs/sequences/changes` refs. The `accounts` and the `groups` sequence refs
are stored in the `All-Users` git repository, whilst the `changes`
sequence exist for each project repo.

This command allows to display the current sequence value for those sequences.

The link:cmd-sequence-set.html[sequence-set] command allows to set a new
sequence value.

== ACCESS
