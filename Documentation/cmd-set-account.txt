gerrit set-account
==================

NAME
----
gerrit set-account - Change an account's settings.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
set-account [--full-name <FULLNAME>] [--active|--inactive] \
            [--add-email <EMAIL>] [--delete-email <EMAIL> | ALL] \
            [--add-ssh-key - | <KEY>] \
            [--delete-ssh-key - | <KEY> | ALL] <USERNAME>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Modifies a given user's settings. This command can be useful to
deactivate an account or add/delete ssh keys without going through
the UI.

It also allows managing email addresses, which bypasses the
verification step we force within the UI.

ACCESS
------
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group.

SCRIPTING
---------
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

OPTIONS
-------
<USERNAME>::
	Required; SSH username of the user account.

--full-name::
    Display name of the user account.
+
Names containing spaces should be quoted in single quotes (').
This most likely requires double quoting the value, for example
`--full-name "'A description string'"`.

--active::
    Set the account state to be active.

--inactive::
    Set the account state to be inactive. This prevents the
    user from logging in.

--add-email::
    Add another email to the user's account. This doesn't
    trigger the mail validation and adds the email directly
    to the user's account.

--delete-email::
    Delete an email from this user's account if it exists.
    If the mail provided is 'ALL', all associated mails are
    deleted from this account.

--add-ssh-key::
	Content of the public SSH key to add to the account's
	keyring.  If `-` the key is read from stdin, rather than
	from the command line.

--delete-ssh-key::
    Content of the public SSH key to add to the account's
    keyring.  If `-` the key is read from stdin, rather than
    from the command line. If the key provided is 'ALL', all
    associated SSH keys are removed from this account.

EXAMPLES
--------
Add an email and SSH key to `watcher`'s account:

====
	$ cat ~/.ssh/id_watcher.pub | ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit set-account --add-ssh-key - --add-email mail@example.com watcher
