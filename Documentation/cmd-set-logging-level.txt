== SYNOPSIS
--
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit logging set-level'
  <LEVEL>
  <LOGGER>
--

== DESCRIPTION
Set the logging level of specified loggers.

== Options
<LEVEL>::
  Required; logging level for which the loggers should be set.
  'reset' can be used to revert all loggers back to their level
  at deployment time.

<LOGGER>::
  The logger or loggers that will have their level changed. Multiple
  loggers can be added at once by adding "^" in front of the argument, which
  will cause the argument to be interpreted as a regex. The
  link:http://www.brics.dk/automaton/[dk.brics.automaton
  library] is used for evaluation of the regex. If this argument
  is not provided, all loggers will have their level changed. Note that
  this argument has no effect if 'reset' is passed in LEVEL.

== ACCESS
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group.

== Examples

Change the logging level of the loggers in the package com.google to DEBUG.
=====
    $ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit logging set-level \
     ^com.google.* debug
=====

Reset the logging level of every logger to what they were at deployment time.
