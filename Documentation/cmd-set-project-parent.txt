== DESCRIPTION
Changes the project that permissions are inherited through.
Every project inherits permissions from another project, by
default this is `All-Projects`.  This command sets
the project to inherit through another one.

== ACCESS
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group
or, if
link:config-gerrit.html#receive.allowProjectOwnersToChangeParent[receive.allowProjectOwnersToChangeParent]
is enabled, be a project owner of the projects that is getting their
parent updated.

== SCRIPTING
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

== OPTIONS
--parent::
	Name of the parent to inherit through. If not specified,
	the parent is set back to the default `All-Projects`.

--children-of::
	Name of the parent project for which all child projects should be
	reparented. If the new parent project or any project in its
	parent line is a child of this parent project it is automatically
	excluded from reparenting.

--exclude::
	Name of a child project that should not be reparented. This
	option can only be used if the option --children-of is set.
	Multiple child projects can be excluded from reparenting by
	specifying the --exclude option multiple times. Excluding a
	project that is not a child project has no effect.

== EXAMPLES

----
$ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit set-project-parent --parent kernel/common kernel/omap
----
