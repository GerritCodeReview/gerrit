DESCRIPTION
-----------
Changes the project(s) that permissions are inherited through.
Every project inherits permissions from at least one other project,
by default this is `\-- All Projects \--`.  This command sets
the project to inherit through other projects.  Options for this
command are processed one project at a time in the following order:
`--clear`, then `--set`, then `--delete`, and finally `--add`.  All
the operations will modify every project.  After altering the
parent set of a project, if the set is to become null for that
project, the parent set will be reset to `\-- All Projects \--`.

Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group.
