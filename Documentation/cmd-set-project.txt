== DESCRIPTION
Modifies a given project's settings. This command can be useful to
batch change projects.

The command is argument-safe, that is, if no argument is given the
previous settings are kept intact.

== ACCESS
Caller must be an owner of the given project.

== SCRIPTING
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

== OPTIONS
<NAME>::
    Required; name of the project to edit.  If name ends
    with `.git` the suffix will be automatically removed.

--description::
-d::
    New description of the project.  If not specified,
    the old description is kept.
+
Description values containing spaces should be quoted in single quotes
(').  This most likely requires double quoting the value, for example
`--description "'A description string'"`.

--submit-type::
-t::
    Action used by Gerrit to submit an approved change to its
    destination branch.  Supported options are:
+
* FAST_FORWARD_ONLY: produces a strictly linear history.
* MERGE_IF_NECESSARY: create a merge commit when required.
* REBASE_IF_NECESSARY: rebase the commit when required.
* REBASE_ALWAYS: always rebase the commit including dependencies.
* MERGE_ALWAYS: always create a merge commit.
* CHERRY_PICK: always cherry-pick the commit.

+
For more details see
link:project-configuration.html#submit_type[Submit Types].

--content-merge::
    If enabled, Gerrit will try to perform a 3-way merge of text
    file content when a file has been modified by both the
    destination branch and the change being submitted.  This
    option only takes effect if submit type is not
    FAST_FORWARD_ONLY.

--contributor-agreements::
    If enabled, authors must complete a contributor agreement
    on the site before pushing any commits or changes to this
    project.

--signed-off-by::
    If enabled, each change must contain a Signed-off-by line
    from either the author or the uploader in the commit message.

--change-id::
    Require a valid link:user-changeid.html[Change-Id] footer
    in any commit uploaded for review. This does not apply to
    commits pushed directly to a branch or tag.

--project-state::
--ps::
    Set project's visibility.
+
* ACTIVE: project is regular and is the default value.
* READ_ONLY: users can see the project if read permission
is granted, but all modification operations are disabled.
* HIDDEN: the project is not visible for those who are not owners

--max-object-size-limit::
	Define maximum Git object size for this project. Pushes containing an
	object larger than this limit will be rejected. This can be used to
	further limit the global
  link:config-gerrit.html#receive.maxObjectSizeLimit[receive.maxObjectSizeLimit]
	and cannot be used to increase that globally set limit.
+
Common unit suffixes of 'k', 'm', or 'g' are supported.

== EXAMPLES
Change project `example` to be hidden, require change id, don't use content merge
and use 'merge if necessary' as merge strategy:

----
    $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit set-project example --submit-type MERGE_IF_NECESSARY\
    --change-id true --content-merge false --project-state HIDDEN
