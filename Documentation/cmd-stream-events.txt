the project repository.

Event output is in JSON, one event per line.

SCHEMA
------
The JSON messages consist of nested objects referencing the *change*,
*patchset*, *account* involved, and other attributes as appropriate.
The currently supported message types are *patchset-added*,
*comment-added*, *change-merged*, and *change-abandoned*.

Note that any field may be missing in the JSON messages, so consumers of
this JSON stream should deal with that appropriately.
