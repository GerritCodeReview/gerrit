== NAME
gerrit stream-events - Monitor events occurring in real time

== SYNOPSIS
--
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit stream-events'
--

== DESCRIPTION

Provides a portal into the major events occurring on the server,
outputting activity data in real-time to the client.  Events are
filtered by the caller's access permissions, ensuring the caller
only receives events for changes they can view on the web, or in
the project repository.

Event output is in JSON, one event per line.

== ACCESS
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group,
or have been granted
link:access-control.html#capability_streamEvents[the 'Stream Events' global capability].

== SCRIPTING
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

== EXAMPLES

====
  $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit stream-events
  {"type":"comment-added",change:{"project":"tools/gerrit", ...}, ...}
  {"type":"comment-added",change:{"project":"tools/gerrit", ...}, ...}
====

== SCHEMA
The JSON messages consist of nested objects referencing the *change*,
*patchSet*, *account* involved, and other attributes as appropriate.

Note that any field may be missing in the JSON messages, so consumers of
this JSON stream should deal with that appropriately.
