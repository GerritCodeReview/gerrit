outputing activity data in real-time to the client.  Events are
filtered by the caller's access permissions, ensuring the caller
only receives events for changes they can view on the web, or in
the project repository.

Event output is in JSON, one event per line.

ACCESS
------
Any user who has configured an SSH key.

SCRIPTING

This command is intended to be used in scripts.

EXAMPLES

  $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit stream-events

  {"type":"comment-added",change:{"project":"tools/gerrit", ...}, ...}

SCHEMA
------
The JSON messages consist of nested objects referencing the *change*,
*patchset*, *account* involved, and other attributes as appropriate.
The currently supported message types are *patchset-created*,
*comment-added*, *change-merged*, and *change-abandoned*.

Note that any field may be missing in the JSON messages, so consumers of
this JSON stream should deal with that appropriately.
