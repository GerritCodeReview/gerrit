== NAME
gerrit stream-events - Monitor events occurring in real time

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
--
_ssh_ -p <port> <host> _gerrit stream-events_
--

== DESCRIPTION

Provides a portal into the major events occurring on the server,
outputting activity data in real-time to the client.  Events are
filtered by the caller's access permissions, ensuring the caller
only receives events for changes they can view on the web, or in
the project repository.

Event output is in JSON, one event per line.

== ACCESS
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group,
or have been granted
link:access-control.html#capability_streamEvents[the 'Stream Events' global capability].

== SCRIPTING
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

== OPTIONS
--subscribe|-s::
	Type of the event to subscribe to.  Multiple --subscribe options
	may be specified to subscribe to multiple events. When this option
	is provided, only subscribed events are emitted and all other
	events are ignored. When this option is omitted, all events are
	emitted.

== EXAMPLES

----
  $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit stream-events
  {"type":"comment-added",change:{"project":"tools/gerrit", ...}, ...}
  {"type":"comment-added",change:{"project":"tools/gerrit", ...}, ...}
----

Only subscribe to specific event types:

----
  $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit stream-events \
      -s patchset-created -s ref-replicated
----

== SCHEMA
The JSON messages consist of nested objects referencing the *change*,
*patchSet*, *account* involved, and other attributes as appropriate.

Note that any field may be missing in the JSON messages, so consumers of
this JSON stream should deal with that appropriately.
