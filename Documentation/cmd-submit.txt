gerrit submit
==============

NAME
----
gerrit submit - Submit one or more patch sets

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit submit' [\--project <PROJECT>] {COMMIT | CHANGEID,PATCHSET}...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Submits the specified patch sets for merging.  Naturally, to be
eligible for merging the patch sets must first have all
approvals met.

Patch sets should be specified as complete or abbreviated commit
SHA-1s.  If the same commit is available in multiple projects the
\--project option may be used to limit where Gerrit searches for
the change to only the contents of the specified project.

For current backward compatibility with user tools patch sets may
also be specified in the legacy 'CHANGEID,PATCHSET' format, such as
'8242,2'.  Support for this legacy format is planned to be removed
in a future edition of Gerrit Code Review.  Use of commit SHA-1s
is strongly encouraged.

OPTIONS
-------

\--project::
-p::
	Name of the project the intended changes are contained
	within.  This option must be supplied before the commit
	SHA-1 in order to take effect.

\--help::
-h::
	Display site-specific usage information, including the
	complete listing of supported approval categories and values.

ACCESS
------
Any user who has configured an SSH key.

SCRIPTING
---------
This command is intended to be used in scripts.

EXAMPLES
--------

Submit the change with commit c0ff33
=====
	$ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit submit --project=this/cafbevs c0ff33
