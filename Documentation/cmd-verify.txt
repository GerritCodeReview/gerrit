==============

== NAME
gerrit verify - Apply verification to one or more patch sets

== SYNOPSIS
--
'ssh' -p <port> <host> 'gerrit verify'
  [--project <PROJECT> | -p <PROJECT>]
  [--branch <BRANCH> | -b <BRANCH>]
  [--verification <PARAMETERS> | -v <PARAMETERS>]
  {COMMIT | CHANGEID,PATCHSET}...
--

== DESCRIPTION
Updates a specified patch or commit with a verification,
sending out email notifications and updating the database.

To report the outcome for multiple jobs at once, the verification
parameter can be used multiple times.

Patch sets may be specified in 'CHANGEID,PATCHSET' format, such as
'8242,2', or 'COMMIT' format.

If a patch set is specified with the 'COMMIT' format, the complete
or abbreviated commit SHA-1 may be used.  If the same commit is available
in multiple projects the `--project` option may be used to limit where
Gerrit searches for the change to only the contents of the specified project.
If the same commit is available in multiple branches the `--branch` option
may be used to limit where Gerrit searches for changes to only the specified
branch.
