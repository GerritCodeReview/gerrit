= Comments

One of the primary benefits of code review is allowing contributors to comment
on and discuss changes. Comments help contributors understand the reasons
behind a specific change.

Gerrit groups comments into the following categories.

.Comment categories
|===
|Comment Type|Description

|Inline comment
|Applies to a particular section of a file in a patch set.

|File level comment
|Applies to a specific file in a patch set.

|Summary comment
|Applies to the change in general.

|===

== Inline comments

Inline comments are comments placed directly on lines or code blocks. You can
create an inline comment either by clicking on a line number of a file, or by
selecting a code block and pressing `c`.

NOTE: When a comment is applied to a code block, the background for that code
block changes to yellow.


To publish inline comments for a patch set, you must click *Reply* at the top of
the Review screen and then click *Send*.

== File comments

File comments are similar to inline comments, except they apply to the entire
file, as opposed to a specific line or code block. You can add file comments
by clicking the *File* link.

To publish inline comments for a patch set, you must click *Reply* at the top of
the Review screen and then click *Send*.


== Comment properties

When you create a new inline or file comment, a comment box appears. This box
contains the following properties:

|===
|Property|Description

|Comment text box
|A text box in which you can write your comment.

|Save
|Saves the comment.
|Discard
|Discards the comment.

|Resolved
|Marks the comment as resolved. Depending on your Gerrit configuration, some
changes cannot be submitted if they have unresolved comments.

|===
|Property|Description
|Author name

|===

== Summary comments

Summary comments are comments that apply to a change as a whole. Summary
comments allow you to send information, such as status updates or requests,
that do not belong to a specific patch set.

Summary comments are available by clicking *Reply* button from the Review
screen.

You can view all the summary comments, along with any inline or file comments
they contain, at the bottom of the Review screen.
