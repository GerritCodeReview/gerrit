= Patch Sets

As described in link:concept-changes.html[Changes], a change represents a single
commit under review. Each change is identified by a _Change-Id_.

Multiple git commits can share the same Change-Id, allowing you to update a
change as you receive feedback through the code review process. In Gerrit,
commits that share the same Change-Id are referred to as _patch sets_. When a
change is approved, only the latest version of a commit is submitted to the
repository.

== File List

When you open a change in Gerrit, a list of affected files appears in the
file list, located in the middle of the Review screen. This table displays
the following information for each file:

* A checkbox, indicating the file has been reviewed
* The type of modification
* The path and name of the file
* The number of added lines and or deleted lines

[[file-modifications]]
== File modifications

Each file in a patch set has a letter next to it, indicating the type of
modification for that file. The following table lists the types of
modifications.

.Types of file modifications
|===
|Letter|Modification Type|Definition

|M
|Modification
|The file existed before this change and is modified.

|A
|Added
|The file is newly added.

|D
|Deleted
|The file is deleted.

|R
|Renamed
|The file is renamed.

|C
|Copied
|The file is new and is copied from an existing file.

|===

If the status is *R* (Renamed) or *C* (Copied), the file list also displays the
original name of the file below the patch set file.

== Views

By default, Gerrit displays the latest patch set for a given change. You can
view previous versions of a patch set by selecting from the *Patch Set* list.

== Diffs

Clicking a file in the file list opens the Diff screen. By default, this
screen displays a diff between the latest patch set's version of a file and the
current version of that file in the repository. You can also open a diff within
the Review screen by clicking the blue triangle located in the same row as the
file. To show the diffs of all files in the Review screen, click the *Show
Diffs* link, located at the top of the file list.

You can diff between other patch sets by selecting a patch set number from the
*Diff Against* list.

== Description

Each change in Gerrit must have a change description. You can also add a
description for a specific patch set. To do so, click *Add a patch set
description*, located in the file list.
