= Gerrit Code Review - Automatic Site Initialization on Startup

== Description

Gerrit supports automatic site initialization on server startup
when Gerrit runs in a servlet container. Both creation of a new site
and upgrade of an existing site are supported. By default, all packaged
plugins will be installed when Gerrit is deployed in a servlet container
and the location of the Gerrit distribution can be determined at
runtime. It is also possible to install only a subset of packaged
plugins or not install any plugins.

This feature may be useful for such setups where Gerrit administrators
don't have direct access to the file system of the server where Gerrit
should be deployed and, therefore, cannot perform the init from their
local machine prior to deploying Gerrit on such a server. It may also
make deployment and testing in a local servlet container faster to set
up as the init step could be skipped.

== Gerrit Configuration

The site initialization will be performed only if the `gerrit.init`
system property exists. The value of the property is not used; only the
existence of the property matters. The `gerrit.site_path` system
property must be set as well.

If the `gerrit.install_plugins` property is not defined then all packaged
plugins will be installed. If it is defined then it is parsed as a
comma-separated list of plugin names to install. If the value is an
empty string then no plugin will be installed.

=== Example

Prepare Tomcat so that a site is initialized at a given path (if the site
doesn't exist yet).
