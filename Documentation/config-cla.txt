= Gerrit Code Review - Contributor Agreements

Users can be required to sign one or more contributor agreements before
being able to submit a change in a project.

Contributor agreements are global and can be configured by modifying
the `project.config` file on the `All-Projects` project. Push permission
needs to be granted for the `refs/meta/config` branch to be able to push
back the `project.config` file. Consult
link:access-control.html[access controls] for details on how access
permissions work.

To retrieve the `project.config` file, initialize a temporary Git
repository to edit the configuration:
----
  mkdir cfg_dir
  cd cfg_dir
  git init
----

Download the existing configuration from Gerrit:
----
  git fetch ssh://localhost:29418/All-Projects refs/meta/config
  git checkout FETCH_HEAD
----

Contributor agreements are defined as contributor-agreement sections in
`project.config` of `All-Projects`:
----
  [contributor-agreement "Individual"]
    description = If you are going to be contributing code on your own, this is the one you want. You can sign this one online.
    agreementUrl = static/cla_individual.html
    autoVerify = group CLA Accepted - Individual
    accepted = group CLA Accepted - Individual
    matchProjects = ^/.*$
    excludeProjects = ^/not/my/project/
----

Each `contributor-agreement` section within the `project.config` file must
have a unique name. The section name will appear in the web UI.

If not already present, add the group(s) used in the `autoVerify` and
`accepted` variables in the `groups` file:
----
    # UUID                                  	Group Name
    #
    3dedb32915ecdbef5fced9f0a2587d164cd614d4	CLA Accepted - Individual
----

Commit the configuration change, and push it back:
----
  git commit -a -m "Add Individual contributor agreement"
  git push ssh://localhost:29418/All-Projects HEAD:refs/meta/config
----
