Gerrit Code Review - Gitweb Integration
=======================================

Gerrit Code Review can generate hyperlinks to gitweb, allowing users
to jump from Gerrit content to the same information, but shown by
gitweb.

To enable the gitweb integration, set gitweb.url with the URL of
your gitweb CGI.

The CGI's `$projectroot` should be the same directory as
gerrit.basePath, or a fairly current replica.  If a replica is
being used, ensure it uses a full mirror, so the `refs/changes/*`
namespace is available.

====
  git config --file $site_path/etc/gerrit.config gitweb.url http://example.com/gitweb.cgi
====

After updating `'$site_path'/etc/gerrit.config`, the Gerrit server must
be restarted and clients must reload the host page to see the change.

Access Control
--------------

Gitweb access controls can be implemented using standard web server
access controls.  This isn't typically integrated with Gerrit's own
access controls.  Caution must be taken to ensure the controls are
consistent if access needs to be restricted.

Caching Gitweb
--------------

If your repository set is large and you are expecting a lot
of users, you may want to look at the caching forks used by
high-traffic sites like kernel.org or repo.or.cz.

Alternatives to gitweb
--------------
There are other alternatives to gitweb that can also be used with gerrit, such
as cgit.

cgit can be used by specifying `gitweb.type` to be 'cgit', it is also possible
to define custom patterns to use for the URLs.
