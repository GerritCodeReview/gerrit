Gerrit2 - Hooks
===============

Gerrit does not run any of the standard git hooks in the repositories
it works with, but it does have its own hook mechanism included. Gerrit
looks in `$\{site_path\}/hooks/` for executables with names listed below.

The environment will have GIT_DIR set to the full path of the affected
git repository so that git commands can be easily run.

Make sure your hook scripts are executable if running on *nix.

new-change
~~~~~~~~~~

This hook will be called for every new change review after it is created.
It is called with the following parameters:

====
  new-change <project name> <change id>
====

update-change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) This hook is called every time a change
review is updated. It is called with these parameters:

====
  update-change <project name> <change id>
====
