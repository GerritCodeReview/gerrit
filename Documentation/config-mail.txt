= Gerrit Code Review - Mail Templates

Gerrit uses link:https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/[Closure Templates,role=external,window=_blank]
(Soy) for the bulk of the standard mails it sends out.
There are builtin default templates which are used if they are not overridden.
These defaults are also provided as examples so that administrators may copy
them and easily modify them to tweak their contents.

*Compatibility Note:* previously, Velocity Template Language (VTL) was used as
the template language for Gerrit emails. Support for VTL has now been removed
in favor of Soy, and Velocity templates that modify text emails are no longer
supported.

== Template Locations and Extensions

The default example templates reside under:  `'$site_path'/etc/mail` and are
terminated with the double extension `.soy.example`. Modifying these example
files will have no effect on the behavior of Gerrit.  However, copying an
example template to an equivalently named file without the `.example` extension
and modifying it will allow an administrator to customize the template.

== Supported Mail Templates

Each mail that Gerrit sends out is controlled by at least one template.  These
are listed below.  Change emails are influenced by two additional templates,
one to set the subject line, and one to set the footer which gets appended to
all the change emails (see `ChangeSubject.soy` and `ChangeFooter.soy` below.)

Many types of Gerrit email message support HTML in addition to plain-text. Where
both are supported, templates to control the HTML part have `...Html` appended
in their file names. For example, for "Abandoned" emails, the `Abandoned.soy`
template determines the text part of the message, whereas `AbandonedHtml.soy`
determines the HTML part.

=== Abandoned.soy and AbandonedHtml.soy

The "Abandoned" templates will determine the contents of the email related to a
change being abandoned.  It is a `ChangeEmail`: see `ChangeSubject.soy` and
ChangeFooter.

=== AddKey.soy and AddKeyHtml.soy

AddKey templates will determine the contents of the email related to SSH and GPG
keys being added to a user account. This notification is not sent when the key
is administratively added to another user account.

=== ChangeFooter.soy and ChangeFooterHtml.soy

The ChangeFooter templates will determine the contents of the footer that will
be appended to emails related to changes (all `ChangeEmail`s).

=== ChangeSubject.soy

The `ChangeSubject.soy` template will determine the contents of the email
subject line for ALL emails related to changes.

=== Comment.soy

The `Comment.soy` template will determine the contents of the email related to
a user submitting comments on changes.  It is a `ChangeEmail`: see
`ChangeSubject.soy`, ChangeFooter and CommentFooter.

=== CommentFooter.soy and CommentFooterHtml.soy

The CommentFooter templates will determine the contents of the footer text that
will be appended to emails related to a user submitting comments on changes.
See `ChangeSubject.soy`, Comment and ChangeFooter.

=== DeleteKey.soy and DeleteKeyHtml.soy

DeleteKey templates will determine the contents of the email related to SSH or GPG keys
being deleted from a user account. This notification is not sent when the key is
administratively deleted from another user account.

=== DeleteVote.soy and DeleteVoteHtml.soy

The DeleteVote templates will determine the contents of the email related to
removing votes on changes.  It is a `ChangeEmail`: see `ChangeSubject.soy`
and ChangeFooter.

=== DeleteReviewer.soy and DeleteReviewerHtml.soy

The DeleteReviewer templates will determine the contents of the email related to
a user removing a reviewer (with a vote) from a change.  It is a
`ChangeEmail`: see `ChangeSubject.soy` and ChangeFooter.

=== Footer.soy and FooterHtml.soy

The Footer templates will determine the contents of the footer text appended to
the end of all outgoing emails after the ChangeFooter and CommentFooter.

=== HttpPasswordUpdate.soy and HttpPasswordUpdateHtml.soy

HttpPasswordUpdate templates will determine the contents of the email related to adding,
changing or deleting the HTTP password on a user account.

change successfully merged to the head.  It is a `ChangeEmail`: see
`ChangeSubject.soy` and ChangeFooter.

=== NewChange.soy and NewChangeHtml.soy

The NewChange templates will determine the contents of the email related to a
user submitting a new change for review. This includes changes created by
actions made by the user in the Web UI such as cherry picking a commit or

related to registering new email accounts.

to a user submitting a new patchset for a change.  This includes patchsets
created by actions made by the user in the Web UI such as editing the commit
message, cherry picking a commit, or rebasing a change.  It is a `ChangeEmail`:
see `ChangeSubject.soy` and ChangeFooter.
