= Plugins

The Gerrit server functionality can be extended by installing plugins.

[[installation]]
== Plugin Installation
Plugin installation is as easy as dropping the plugin jar into the
`$site_path/plugins/` folder. It may take
link:config-gerrit.html#plugins.checkFrequency[a few minutes] until
the server picks up new and updated plugins.

Plugins can also be installed via
link:rest-api-plugins.html#install-plugin[REST] and
link:cmd-plugin-install.html[SSH].

[[development]]
== Plugin Development

How to develop own plugins is described in the link:dev-plugins.html[
Plugin Development Guide].

If you want to share your plugin under link:licenses.html#Apache2_0[
Apache License 2.0] you can host your plugin development on the
link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com[gerrit-review] Gerrit
Server. You can request the creation of a new Project by email
to the link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/repo-discuss[Gerrit
mailing list]. You will be assigned as project owner to the new plugin
project so that you can submit changes on your own. It is the
responsibility of the project owner to maintain the plugin, e.g. to
make sure that it works with new Gerrit versions and to create stable
branches for old releases.

[[core-plugins]]
== Core Plugins

Core plugins are packaged within the Gerrit war file and can easily be
installed during the link:pgm-init.html[Gerrit initialization].

The core plugins are developed and maintained by the Gerrit maintainers
and the Gerrit community.

=== commit-message-length-validator

This plugin checks the length of a commit’s commit message subject and
message body, and reports warnings or errors to the git client if the
lengths are exceeded.

to its managed Git repositories to another system. Usually this would

[[other-plugins]]
== Other Plugins

Besides core plugins there are many other Gerrit plugins available.
These plugins are developed and maintained by different parties.
The Gerrit Project doesn't guarantee proper functioning of any of these
plugins.

The Gerrit Project doesn't provide binaries for these plugins, but
there are some public services, like the

offer the download of ready plugin jars.

=== serviceuser

This plugin allows to create service users in Gerrit.

A service user is a user that is used by another service to communicate

Plugin in Jenkins. A service user is not able to login into the Gerrit
WebUI and it cannot push commits or tags.

=== uploadvalidator

a flatfile based implementation. This implemantation is shareable
amongst multiple Gerrit servers, making it useful for multi-master
Gerrit setups.

=== wip

This plugin adds a new button that allows a change owner to set a
change to Work In Progress, and a button to change from WIP back to a
“Ready For Review” state.

Any change in the WIP state will not show up in anyone’s Review
Requests. Pushing a new patchset will reset the change to Review In
Progress.
