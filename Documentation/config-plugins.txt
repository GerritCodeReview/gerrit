= Plugins

The Gerrit server functionality can be extended by installing plugins.

[[installation]]
== Plugin Installation
Plugin installation is as easy as dropping the plugin jar into the
`$site_path/plugins/` folder. It may take
link:config-gerrit.html#plugins.checkFrequency[a few minutes] until
the server picks up new and updated plugins.

Due to caching, you might need to flush your browser cache after
installing a plugin. Users will usually see the result within
several minutes.

Plugins can also be installed via
link:rest-api-plugins.html#install-plugin[REST] and
link:cmd-plugin-install.html[SSH].

[[development]]
== Plugin Development

How to develop plugins is described in the link:dev-plugins.html[
Plugin Development Guide].

If you want to share your plugin under the link:licenses.html#Apache2_0[
Apache License 2.0] you can host your plugin development on the
link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com[gerrit-review,role=external,window=_blank] Gerrit
Server. You can request the creation of a new Project by email
to the link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/repo-discuss[Gerrit
mailing list,role=external,window=_blank]. You would be assigned as project owner of the new plugin
project so that you can submit changes on your own. It is the
responsibility of the project owner to maintain the plugin, e.g. to
make sure that it works with new Gerrit versions and to create stable
branches for old releases.

[[core-plugins]]
== Core Plugins

link:dev-core-plugins.html[Core plugins] are packaged within the Gerrit
war file and can easily be installed during the link:pgm-init.html[
Gerrit initialization].
