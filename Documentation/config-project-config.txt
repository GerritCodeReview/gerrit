= Gerrit Code Review - Project Configuration File Format

This page explains the storage format of Gerrit's project configuration
and access control models.

The web UI access control panel is a front end for human-readable
configuration files under the +refs/meta/config+ namespace in the
affected project.  Direct manipulation of these files is mainly
relevant in an automation scenario of the access controls.


== The +refs/meta/config+ namespace

The namespace contains three different files that play different
roles in the permission model.  With read permission to that reference,
it is possible to fetch the +refs/meta/config+ reference to a local
repository.  A nice side effect is that you can also upload changes
to project permissions and review them just like with regular code
changes. The preview changes option is also provided on the UI. Please note
that you will have to configure push rights for the +refs/meta/config+ name
space if you'd like to use the possibility to automate permission updates.

== Property inheritance

If a property is set to INHERIT, then the value from the parent project is
used. If the property is not set in any parent project, the default value is
FALSE.

[[file-project_config]]
== The file +project.config+

The +project.config+ file contains the link between groups and their
permitted actions on reference patterns in this project and any projects
that inherit its permissions.

The format in this file corresponds to the Git config file format, so
if you want to automate your permissions it is a good idea to use the
+git config+ command when writing to the file. This way you know you
don't accidentally break the format of the file.

Here follows a +git config+ command example:

----
$ git config -f project.config project.description "Rights inherited by all other projects"
----

Below you will find an example of the +project.config+ file format:

----
[project]
       description = Rights inherited by all other projects
[access "refs/*"]
       read = group Administrators
[access "refs/heads/*"]
        label-Your-Label-Here = -1..+1 group Administrators
[capability]
       administrateServer = group Administrators
[receive]
       requireContributorAgreement = false
[label "Your-Label-Here"]
        function = MaxWithBlock
        value = -1 Your -1 Description
        value =  0 Your No score Description
        value = +1 Your +1 Description
----

As you can see, there are several sections.

The link:#project-section[+project+ section] appears once per project.

The link:#access-section[+access+ section] appears once per reference pattern,
such as `+refs/*+` or `+refs/heads/*+`.  Only one access section per pattern is
allowed.

The link:#receive-section[+receive+ section] appears once per project.

The link:#submit-section[+submit+ section] appears once per project.

The link:#capability-section[+capability+] section only appears once, and only
in the +All-Projects+ repository.  It controls core features that are configured
on a global level.

The link:#label-section[+label+] section can appear multiple times. You can
also redefine the text and behavior of the built in label types `Code-Review`
and `Verified`.

Optionally a +commentlink+ section can be added to define project-specific
comment links. The +commentlink+ section has the same format as the
link:config-gerrit.html#commentlink[+commentlink+ section in gerrit.config]
which is used to define global comment links.

[[project-section]]
=== Project section

The project section includes configuration of project settings.

These are the keys:

[[description]]description::
+
A description for the project.

[[state]]state::
+
This setting defines the state of the project. A project can have the
following states:

- `Active`:
+
The project is active and users can see and modify the project according
to their access rights on the project.

- `Read Only`:
+
The project is read only and all modifying operations on it are
disabled. E.g. this means that pushing to this project fails for all
users even if they have push permissions assigned on it.
+
Setting a project to this state is an easy way to temporary close a
project, as you can keep all write access rights in place and they will
become active again as soon as the project state is set back to
`Active`.
+
This state also makes sense if a project was moved to another location.
In this case all new development should happen in the new project and
you want to prevent that somebody accidentally works on the old
project, while keeping the old project around for old references.

- `Hidden`:
+
The project is hidden and only visible to project owners. Other users
are not able to see the project even if they have read permissions
granted on the project.


[[receive-section]]
=== Receive section

The receive section includes configuration of project-specific
receive settings:

[[receive.requireContributorAgreement]]receive.requireContributorAgreement::
+
Controls whether or not a user must complete a contributor agreement before
they can upload changes. Default is `INHERIT`. If `All-Project` enables this
option then the dependent project must set it to false if users are not
required to sign a contributor agreement prior to submitting changes for that
specific project. To use that feature the global option in `gerrit.config`
must be enabled:
link:config-gerrit.html#auth.contributorAgreements[auth.contributorAgreements].

[[receive.requireSignedOffBy]]receive.requireSignedOffBy::
+
Sign-off can be a requirement for some projects (for example Linux kernel uses
it). Sign-off is a line at the end of the commit message which certifies who
is the author of the commit. Its main purpose is to improve tracking of who
did  what, especially with patches. Default is `INHERIT`, which means that this
property is inherited from the parent project.

[[receive.maxObjectSizeLimit]]receive.maxObjectSizeLimit::
+
Maximum allowed Git object size that receive-pack will accept. If an object
is larger than the given size the pack-parsing will abort and the push
operation will fail. If set to zero then there is no limit.
+
Project owners can use this setting to prevent developers from pushing
objects which are too large to Gerrit. This setting can also be set in
`gerrit.config` globally (link:config-gerrit.html#receive.maxObjectSizeLimit[
receive.maxObjectSizeLimit]).
+
The project specific setting in `project.config` may not set a value higher
than the global limit (if configured). In other words, it is only honored when
it further reduces the global limit.
+
When link:config-gerrit.html#receive.inheritProjectMaxObjectSizeLimit[
`receive.inheritProjectmaxObjectSizeLimit`] is enabled in the global config,
the value is inherited from the parent project. Otherwise, it is not inherited
and must be explicitly set per project.
+
Default is zero.
+
Common unit suffixes of k, m, or g are supported.

[[receive.checkReceivedObjects]]receive.checkReceivedObjects::
+
Controls whether or not the JGit functionality for checking received objects
is enabled.
+
By default Gerrit checks the validity of git objects. Setting this variable to
false should not be used unless a project with history containing invalid
objects needs to be pushed into a Gerrit repository.
+
This functionality is provided as some other git implementations have allowed
bad history to be written into git repositories. If these repositories need pushing
up to Gerrit then the JGit checks need to be disabled.
+
The default value for this is true, false disables the checks.

[[receive.enableSignedPush]]receive.enableSignedPush::
+
Controls whether server-side signed push validation is enabled on the
project. Only has an effect if signed push validation is enabled on the
server; see the link:config-gerrit.html#receive.enableSignedPush[global
configuration] for details.
+
Default is `INHERIT`, which means that this property is inherited from
the parent project.

[[receive.requireSignedPush]]receive.requireSignedPush::
+
Controls whether server-side signed push validation is required on the
project. Only has an effect if signed push validation is enabled on the
server, and link:#receive.enableSignedPush[`receive.enableSignedPush`] is
set on the project. See the
link:config-gerrit.html#receive.enableSignedPush[global configuration]
for details.
+
Default is `INHERIT`, which means that this property is inherited from
the parent project.

[[receive.rejectImplicitMerges]]receive.rejectImplicitMerges::
+
Controls whether a check for implicit merges will be performed when changes are
pushed for review. An implicit merge is a case where merging an open change
would implicitly merge another branch into the target branch. Typically, this
happens when a change is done on master and, by mistake, pushed to a stable branch
for review. When submitting such change, master would be implicitly merged into
stable without anyone noticing that. When this option is set to 'true' Gerrit
will reject the push if an implicit merge is detected.
+
This check is only done for non-merge commits, merge commits are not subject of
the implicit merge check.
+
Default is `INHERIT`, which means that this property is inherited from
the parent project.

[[receive.createNewChangeForAllNotInTarget]]receive.createNewChangeForAllNotInTarget::
+
The `create-new-change-for-all-not-in-target` option provides a
convenience for selecting link:user-upload.html#base[the merge base]
by setting it automatically to the target branch's tip so you can
create new changes for all commits not in the target branch.

This option is disabled if the tip of the push is a merge commit.

This option also only works if there are no merge commits in the
commit chain, in such cases it fails warning the user that such
pushes can only be performed by manually specifying
link:user-upload.html#base[bases]

This option is useful if you want to push a change to your personal
branch first and for review to another branch for example. Or in cases
where a commit is already merged into a branch and you want to create
a new open change for that commit on another branch.

[[change-section]]
=== Change section

The change section includes configuration for project-specific change settings:

[[change.privateByDefault]]change.privateByDefault::
+
Controls whether all new changes in the project are set as private by default.
+
Note that a new change will be public if the `is_private` field in
link:rest-api-changes.html#change-input[ChangeInput] is set to `false` explicitly
when calling the link:rest-api-changes.html#create-change[CreateChange] REST API
or the `remove-private` link:user-upload.html#private[PushOption] is used during
the Git push.
+
Default is `INHERIT`, which means that this property is inherited from
the parent project.

[[change.workInProgressByDefault]]change.workInProgressByDefault::
+
Controls whether all new changes in the project are set as WIP by default.
+
Note that a new change will be ready if the `workInProgress` field in
link:rest-api-changes.html#change-input[ChangeInput] is set to `false` explicitly
when calling the link:rest-api-changes.html#create-change[CreateChange] REST API
or the `ready` link:user-upload.html#wip[PushOption] is used during
the Git push.
+
Default is `INHERIT`, which means that this property is inherited from
the parent project.

[[submit-section]]
=== Submit section

The submit section includes configuration of project-specific
submit settings:

- 'mergeContent': Defines whether to automatically merge changes.  Valid values
are 'true', 'false', or 'INHERIT'.  Default is 'INHERIT'.

- 'action': defines the link:#submit-type[submit type].  Valid
values are 'fast forward only', 'merge if necessary', 'rebase if necessary',
'merge always' and 'cherry pick'.  The default is 'merge if necessary'.

- 'matchAuthorToCommitterDate': Defines whether to the author date will be changed to match the
submitter date upon submit, so that git log shows when the change was submitted instead of when the
author last committed. Valid values are 'true', 'false', or 'INHERIT'. The default is 'INHERIT'.
This option only takes effect in submit strategies which already modify the commit, i.e.
Cherry Pick, Rebase Always, and (perhaps) Rebase If Necessary.

- 'rejectEmptyCommit': Defines whether empty commits should be rejected when a change is merged.
Changes might not seem empty at first but when attempting to merge, rebasing can lead to an empty
commit. If this option is set to 'true' the merge would fail. An empty commit is still allowed as
the initial commit on a branch.

Merge strategy


[[access-section]]
=== Access section

Each +access+ section includes a reference and access rights connected
to groups.  Each group listed must exist in the link:#file-groups[+groups+ file].

Please refer to the
link:access-control.html#access_categories[Access Categories]
documentation for a full list of available access rights.


[[mimetype-section]]
=== MIME Types section

The +mimetype+ section may be configured to force the web code
reviewer to return certain MIME types by file path. MIME types
may be used to activate syntax highlighting.

----
[mimetype "text/x-c"]
  path = *.pkt
[mimetype "text/x-java"]
  path = api/current.txt
----


[[capability-section]]
=== Capability section

The +capability+ section only appears once, and only in the +All-Projects+
repository.  It controls Gerrit administration capabilities that are configured
on a global level.

Please refer to the
link:access-control.html#global_capabilities[Global Capabilities]
documentation for a full list of available capabilities.

[[label-section]]
=== Label section

Please refer to link:config-labels.html#label_custom[Custom Labels] documentation.

[[branchOrder-section]]
=== branchOrder section

Defines a branch ordering which is used for backporting of changes.
Backporting will be offered for a change (in the Gerrit UI) for all
more stable branches where the change can merge cleanly.

[[branchOrder.branch]]branchOrder.branch::
+
A branch name, typically multiple values will be defined. The order of branch
names in this section defines the branch order. The topmost is considered to be
the least stable branch (typically the master branch) and the last one the
most stable (typically the last maintained release branch).

Example:

----
[branchOrder]
  branch = master
  branch = stable-2.9
  branch = stable-2.8
  branch = stable-2.7
----

The `branchOrder` section is inheritable. This is useful when multiple or all
projects follow the same branch rules. A `branchOrder` section in a child
project completely overrides any `branchOrder` section from a parent i.e. there
is no merging of `branchOrder` sections. A present but empty `branchOrder`
section removes all inherited branch order.

Branches not listed in this section will not be included in the mergeability
check. If the `branchOrder` section is not defined then the mergeability of a
change into other branches will not be done.

[[reviewer-section]]
=== reviewer section

Defines config options to adjust a project's reviewer workflow such as enabling
reviewers and CCs by email.

[[reviewer.enableByEmail]]reviewer.enableByEmail::
+
A boolean indicating if reviewers and CCs that do not currently have a Gerrit
account can be added to a change by providing their email address.

This setting only takes affect for changes that are readable by anonymous users.

Default is `INHERIT`, which means that this property is inherited from
the parent project. If the property is not set in any parent project, the
default value is `FALSE`.

[[file-groups]]
== The file +groups+

Each group in this list is linked with its UUID so that renaming of
groups is possible without having to rewrite every +groups+ file
in every repository where it's used.

This is what the default groups file for +All-Projects.git+ looks like:

----
# UUID                                         Group Name
#
3d6da7dc4e99e6f6e5b5196e21b6f504fc530bba       Administrators
global:Anonymous-Users                         Anonymous Users
global:Change-Owner                            Change Owner
global:Project-Owners                          Project Owners
global:Registered-Users                        Registered Users
----

This file can't be written to by the +git config+ command.

In order to reference a group in +project.config+, it must be listed in
the +groups+ file.  When editing permissions through the web UI this
file is maintained automatically, but when pushing updates to
+refs/meta/config+ this must be dealt with by hand.  Gerrit will refuse
+project.config+ files that refer to groups not listed in +groups+.

The UUID of a group can be found on the General tab of the group's page
in the web UI or via the +-v+ option to
link:cmd-ls-groups.html[the +ls-groups+ SSH command].


[[file-rules_pl]]
== The file +rules.pl+

The +rules.pl+ files allows you to replace or amend the default Prolog
rules that control e.g. what conditions need to be fulfilled for a
change to be submittable.  This file content should be
interpretable by the 'Prolog Cafe' interpreter.

You can read more about the +rules.pl+ file and the prolog rules on
link:prolog-cookbook.html[the Prolog cookbook page].

[[submit-type]]
=== Submit Type

The method Gerrit uses to submit a change to a project can be
modified by any project owner through the project console, `Projects` >
`List` > my/project. In general, a submitted change is only merged if all
its dependencies are also submitted, with exceptions documented below.
The following submit types are supported:

[[submit_type_inherit]]
* Inherit
+
This is the default for new projects, unless overridden by a global
link:config-gerrit.html#repository.name.defaultSubmitType[`defaultSubmitType` option].
+
Inherit the submit type from the parent project. In `All-Projects`, this
is equivalent to link:#merge_if_necessary[Merge If Necessary].

[[fast_forward_only]]
* Fast Forward Only
+
With this method no merge commits are produced. All merges must
be handled on the client, prior to uploading to Gerrit for review.
+
To submit a change, the change must be a strict superset of the
destination branch.  That is, the change must already contain the
tip of the destination branch at submit time.

[[merge_if_necessary]]
* Merge If Necessary
+
If the change being submitted is a strict superset of the destination
branch, then the branch is fast-forwarded to the change.  If not,
then a merge commit is automatically created.  This is identical
to the classical `git merge` behavior, or `git merge --ff`.

[[always_merge]]
* Always Merge
+
Always produce a merge commit, even if the change is a strict
superset of the destination branch.  This is identical to the
behavior of `git merge --no-ff`, and may be useful if the
project needs to follow submits with `git log --first-parent`.

[[cherry_pick]]
* Cherry Pick
+
Always cherry pick the patch set, ignoring the parent lineage
and instead creating a brand new commit on top of the current
branch head.
+
When cherry picking a change, Gerrit automatically appends onto the
end of the commit message a short summary of the change's approvals,
and a URL link back to the change on the web.  The committer header
is also set to the submitter, while the author header retains the
original patch set author.
+
Note that Gerrit ignores dependencies between changes when using this
submit type unless
link:config-gerrit.html#change.submitWholeTopic[`change.submitWholeTopic`]
is enabled and depending changes share the same topic. So generally
submitters must remember to submit changes in the right order when using this
submit type. If all you want is extra information in the commit message,
consider using the Rebase Always submit strategy.

[[rebase_if_necessary]]
* Rebase If Necessary
+
If the change being submitted is a strict superset of the destination
branch, then the branch is fast-forwarded to the change.  If not,
then the change is automatically rebased and then the branch is
fast-forwarded to the change.

When Gerrit tries to do a merge, by default the merge will only
succeed if there is no path conflict.  A path conflict occurs when
the same file has also been changed on the other side of the merge.

[[rebase_always]]
* Rebase Always
+
Basically, the same as Rebase If Necessary, but it creates a new patchset even
if fast forward is possible AND like Cherry Pick it ensures footers such as
Change-Id, Reviewed-On, and others are present in resulting commit that is
merged.

Thus, Rebase Always can be considered similar to Cherry Pick, but with
the important distinction that Rebase Always does not ignore dependencies.

[[content_merge]]
=== Allow content merges
If `Allow content merges` is enabled, Gerrit will try
to do a content merge when a path conflict occurs.
