Gerrit Code Review - Project Configuration File Format
======================================================

This page explains the inner workings of the access control model of
Gerrit.  The web UI access control panel is a front end for human
readable configuration files under the +refs/meta/config+ namespace
in the affected project.  Direct manipulation of these files is
mainly relevant in an automation scenario of the access controls.


The +refs/meta/config+ name space
---------------------------------

The name space contains three different files that play different
roles in the permission model.  With read permission to that reference,
it is possible to fetch the +refs/meta/config+ reference to a local
repository.  A nice side effect is that you can also upload changes
to project permissions and review them just like with regular code
changes.  Please note that you will have to configure push rights
for the refs/meta/config name space if you'd like to use the
possibility to automate permission updates.


[[file-project_config]]
The file +project.config+
-------------------------

The +project.config+ file contains the link between groups and their
permitted actions on reference patterns in this project and any projects
that inherit its permissions.
The format in this file corresponds to the Git config file format, so
if you want to automate your permissions it is a good idea to use the
+git config+ command when writing to the file. This way you know you
don't accidentally break the format of the file.

Here follows a +git config+ command example:

----
$ git config -f project.config project.description "Rights inherited by all other projects"
----

Below you will find an example of the +project.config+ file format:

----
[project]
       description = Rights inherited by all other projects
[access "refs/*"]
       read = group Administrators
[capability]
       administrateServer = group Administrators
----

As you can see, there are three kinds of sections.  The +project+
section only appears once per project, and it only consists of
one key, +description+.  The +access+ section appears once per
reference pattern, such as `refs/*` or `refs/heads/*`.  Only one
access section per pattern is allowed.  You will find examples of keys
and values in each category section <<access_category,below>>.
The +capability+ section only appears once, and only in the
+All-Projects+ repository.  It controls core features that are
configured on a global level.  You can find examples of these too
<<capability_category,below>>.


[[project-section]]
Project section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project section includes configuration of project settings.

These are the categories:

- Description
- Automatically merge
- Merge strategy


[[access-section]]
Access section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each +access+ section includes a reference and access rights connected
to groups.

Here's a list of the current default access rights:

- inheritFrom
- exclusiveGroupPermissions
- Label: Code Review
- Create reference
- Forge Author
- Forge Committer
- Forge Server
- Owner
- Push
- Direct Push
- Upload To Code Review
- Push Merge Commits
- Push Annotated Tag
- Read
- Submit


[[capability-section]]
Capabilities section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The +capability+ section only appears once, and only in the
+All-Projects+ repository.  It controls core features that are
configured on a global level.

A list of the capabilities:

- Administrate Server
- Create Account
- Create Group
- Create Project
- Flush Caches
- Kill Task
- Priority
- Query Limit
- Start Replication
- View Caches


[[file-groups]]
The file +groups+
-----------------

Each group in this list is linked with each UUID so that renaming of
groups is still possible without having to rewrite every +groups+ file
in every repository where it's used.

This is what the default groups file for +All-Projects.git+ looks like:

----
# UUID                                         Group Name
#
3d6da7dc4e99e6f6e5b5196e21b6f504fc530bba       Administrators
global:Anonymous-Users                         Anonymous Users
global:Project-Owners                          Project Owners
global:Registered-Users                        Registered Users
----

This file can't be written to by the +git config+ command.

In order to reference a group in project.config, it must be listed in
the +groups+ file.  When editing permissions through the web UI this
file is maintained automatically, but when pushing updates to
+refs/meta/config+ this must be dealt with by hand.  Gerrit will refuse
+project.config+ files that refer to groups not listed in +groups+.

The UUID of a group can be found on the General tab of the group's page
in the web UI or via the +-v+ option to
link:cmd-ls-groups.html[the +ls-groups+ SSH command].


[[file-rules_pl]]
The file +rules.pl+
-------------------

The +rules.pl+ files allows you to replace or amend the default Prolog
rules that control e.g. what conditions need to be fulfilled for a
change to be submittable.  This file content should be
interpretable by the 'Prolog Cafe' interpreter.

You can read more about the +rules.pl+ file and the prolog rules on
link:prolog-cookbook.html[the Prolog cookbook page].
