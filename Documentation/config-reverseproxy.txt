Gerrit Code Review - Reverse Proxy
==================================

Description
-----------

Gerrit can be configured to run behind an Apache server using
'mod_proxy'.  This allows Apache to bind to the privileged ports 80
(or 443 for SSL), as well as offloads the SSL processing overhead
from Java to optimized native C code.


Configuration
------------

Enable the necessary Apache2 modules:

----
  a2enmod proxy_http
  a2enmod ssl          ; # optional, needed for HTTPS / SSL
----

Ensure `'$site_path'/etc/gerrit.config` has the property
link:config-gerrit.html#httpd.listenUrl[httpd.listenUrl] configured
to use 'proxy-http://' or 'proxy-https://' and a free port number.
This may have already been configured if proxy support was enabled
during 'init'.

----
  [httpd]
  	listenUrl = proxy-http://127.0.0.1:8081/r/
----

Configure an Apache VirtualHost to proxy to the Gerrit daemon,
setting the 'ProxyPass' line to use the 'http://' URL configured
above.  Ensure the path of ProxyPass and httpd.listenUrl match,
or links will redirect to incorrect locations.

----
	<VirtualHost *>
	  ServerName review.example.com

	  ProxyRequests Off
	  ProxyVia Off
	  ProxyPreserveHost On

	  <Proxy *>
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from all
	  </Proxy>

	  ProxyPass /r/ http://127.0.0.1:8081/r/
	</VirtualHost>
----

SSL
~~~

To enable Apache to perform the SSL processing, use 'proxy-https://'
in httpd.listenUrl within Gerrit's configuration file, and enable
the SSL engine in the Apache VirtualHost block:

----
	<VirtualHost *:443>
	  SSLEngine on
	  SSLCertificateFile    conf/server.crt
	  SSLCertificateKeyFile conf/server.key

	  ... same as above ...
	</VirtualHost>
----

See the Apache 'mod_ssl' documentation for more details on how to
configure SSL within the server, like controlling how strong of an
encryption algorithm is required.
