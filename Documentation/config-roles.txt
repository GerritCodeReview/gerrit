= Gerrit Code Review - Access Roles

To be able to reuse typical access configuration you can group
permissions in roles that are defined in the project.config.
These roles can then be used in access configuration just like
the default permissions.

[[role_custom]]
== Customized Roles

Site administrators and project owners can define their own roles,
or override roles inherited from parent projects like so:

----
[role "my-role"]
  permission = role-permission
  permission = role permission
----

[[role_permission]]
=== Role Permission

----
PERMISSION [RANGE | FORCE]
----

A role permissions consist of a permission and an option. The option
can be one of force ("+force") and a range (f.i. "-2..+2").
The force option is honored when the permission is "push" and the
range option is only allowed for permissions that have
a range.

[[role_inheritance]]
=== Inheritance

Roles are inherited from parent projects. A child project may add,
override, or remove labels defined in its parents.

Overriding a role in a child project overrides all its properties and
values. It is not possible to modify an inherited role by adding
properties in the child project's configuration; all properties from
the parent definition must be redefined in the child.

[[role_example]]
=== Example

To define a new role:

----
  [role "developer"]
      permission = read
      permission = push +push
      permission = label-Code-Review -2..+1
----

When used in the access control:

----
  [access "refs/heads/develop"]
      role-developer = group the-developers
----

It will be equivalent to the configuration:

----
  [access "refs/heads/develop"]
      read = group the-developers
      push = +push group the-developers
      label-Code-Review = -2..+1 group the-developers
