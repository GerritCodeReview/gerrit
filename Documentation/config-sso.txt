= Gerrit Code Review - Single Sign-On Security

Gerrit supports integration with some types of single sign-on
security solutions, making it possible for end-users to setup
and manage accounts, without administrator involvement.

== OpenID

By default a new Gerrit installation relies upon OpenID to perform
user authentication services.  To enable OpenID, the auth.type
setting should be `OpenID`:

----
  git config --file $site_path/etc/gerrit.config auth.type OpenID
----

As this is the default setting there is nothing required from the
site administrator to make use of the OpenID authentication services.

* http://openid.net/[openid.net,,role=external,window=_blank]

If Jetty is being used, you may need to increase the header
buffer size parameter, due to very long header lines.
Add the following to `$JETTY_HOME/etc/jetty.xml` under
`org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector`:

----
  <Set name="headerBufferSize">16384</Set>
----

In order to use permissions beyond those granted to the
`Anonymous Users` and `Registered Users` groups, an account
must only have OpenIDs which match at least one pattern from the
`auth.trustedOpenID` list in `gerrit.config`.  Patterns may be
either a
link:http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[standard
Java regular expression (java.util.regex),,role=external,window=_blank] (must start with `^`
and end with `$`) or be a simple prefix (any other string).

Out of the box Gerrit is configured to trust two patterns, which
will match any OpenID provider on the Internet:

* `http://` -- trust all OpenID providers using the HTTP protocol
* `https://` -- trust all OpenID providers using the HTTPS protocol

To trust only Yahoo!:
----
  git config --file $site_path/etc/gerrit.config auth.trustedOpenID https://me.yahoo.com
----

=== Database Schema

User identities obtained from OpenID providers are stored as
link:config-accounts.html#external-ids[external IDs].

=== Multiple Identities

Users may link more than one OpenID identity to the same Gerrit account, making
it easier for their browser to sign in to Gerrit if they are frequently switching
between different unique OpenID accounts.

[WARNING]
Users wishing to link an alternative identity should *NOT* log in separately
with that identity. Doing so will result in a new account being created, and
subsequent attempts to link that account with the existing account will fail.
In cases where this happens, the administrator will need to manually merge the
accounts.  See link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/homepage/+/md-pages/docs/SqlMergeUserAccounts.md[
Merging Gerrit User Accounts,,role=external,window=_blank] on the Gerrit Wiki for details.

Linking another identity is also useful for users whose primary OpenID provider
shuts down. For example Google
link:https://developers.google.com/+/api/auth-migration[shut down their OpenID
service on 20th April 2015,,role=external,window=_blank]. Users who failed to add an alternative identity with
another OpenID provider before that date will end up with their account only having
a disabled Google identity. After creating a separate account with an alternative
provider, they will need to ask the administrator to merge the accounts using the
previously mentioned method.

To link another identity to an existing account:

* Login with the existing account
* Select menu Settings -> Identities
* Click the 'Link Another Identity' button
* Select the OpenID provider for the other identity
* Authenticate with the other identity

Login using the other identity can only be performed after the linking is
successful.

== HTTP Basic Authentication

When using HTTP authentication, Gerrit assumes that the servlet
container or the frontend web server has performed all user
authentication prior to handing the request off to Gerrit.

As a result of this assumption, Gerrit can assume that any and
all requests have already been authenticated.  The "Sign In" and
"Sign Out" links are therefore not displayed in the web UI.

To enable this form of authentication:

----
  git config --file $site_path/etc/gerrit.config auth.type HTTP
  git config --file $site_path/etc/gerrit.config --unset auth.httpHeader
  git config --file $site_path/etc/gerrit.config auth.emailFormat '{0}@example.com'
----

The auth.type must always be HTTP, indicating the user identity
will be obtained from the HTTP authorization data.

The auth.httpHeader must always be unset.  If set to any value
(including `Authorization`) then Gerrit won't correctly honor the
standard `Authorization` HTTP header.

The auth.emailFormat field ('optional') sets the preferred email
address during first login.  Gerrit will replace `{0}` with the
username, as obtained from the Authorization header.  A format such
as shown in the example would be typical, to add the domain name
of the organization.

If Apache HTTPd is being used as the primary web server and the
Apache server will be handling user authentication, a configuration
such as the following is recommended to ensure Apache performs the
authentication at the proper time:

----
  <Location "/login/">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Gerrit Code Review"
    Require valid-user
    ...
  </Location>
----

=== Database Schema

User identities are stored as
link:config-accounts.html#external-ids[external IDs] with "gerrit" as
scheme. The user string obtained from the authorization header is
stored as ID of the external ID.


== Computer Associates Siteminder

Siteminder is a commercial single sign on solution marketed by
Computer Associates.  It is very common in larger enterprise
environments.

When using Siteminder, Gerrit assumes it has been installed in a
servlet container which is running behind an Apache web server,
and that the Siteminder authentication module has been configured
within Apache to protect the entire Gerrit application.  In this
configuration all users must authenticate with Siteminder before
they can access any resource on Gerrit.

As a result of this assumption, Gerrit can assume that any and
all requests have already been authenticated.  The "Sign In" and
"Sign Out" links are therefore not displayed in the web UI.

To enable this form of authentication:

----
  git config --file $site_path/etc/gerrit.config auth.type HTTP
  git config --file $site_path/etc/gerrit.config auth.httpHeader SM_USER
  git config --file $site_path/etc/gerrit.config auth.emailFormat '{0}@example.com'
----

The auth.type must always be HTTP, indicating the user identity
will be obtained from the HTTP authorization data.

The auth.httpHeader indicates in which HTTP header field the Siteminder
product has stored the username.  Usually this is "SM_USER", but
may differ in your environment.  Please refer to your organization's
single sign-on or security group to ensure the setting is correct.

The auth.emailFormat field ('optional') sets the user's preferred
email address when they first login.  Gerrit will replace `{0}`
with the username, as supplied by Siteminder.  A format such as
shown in the example would be typical, to add the domain name of
the organization.

If Jetty is being used, you may need to increase the header
buffer size parameter, due to very long header lines.
Add the following to `$JETTY_HOME/etc/jetty.xml` under
`org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector`:

----
  <Set name="headerBufferSize">16384</Set>
----


=== Database Schema

User identities are stored as
link:config-accounts.html#external-ids[external IDs] with "gerrit" as
scheme. The user string obtained from Siteminder (e.g. the value in the
"SM_USER" HTTP header) is stored as ID in the external ID.
