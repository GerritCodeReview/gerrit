= Gerrit Code Review - Themes

Gerrit supports some customization of the HTML it sends to
the browser, allowing organizations to alter the look and
feel of the application to fit with their general scheme.

== Obsolete customization options
Old versions of Gerrit supported themes through the following files.

* `etc/GerritSiteHeader.html`
* `etc/GerritSiteFooter.html`
* `etc/GerritSite.css`

Since the move from GWT to Polygerrit in link:https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.0.html#release-highlights[Gerrit 3.0], these themes are no longer supported.

Customizing themes by placing HTML files under the `'$site_path'/plugins` directory is deprecated https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.4.html#html-plugin-support-is-removed[since Gerrit 3.4].

== Writing themes for PolyGerrit

The current way of customizing Gerrit themes, is by writing plugins as described in link:pg-plugin-dev.html[Polygerrit plugin Development].

== Static Images

Static image files can also be served from `'$site_path'/static`,
and may be referenced in `GerritSite{Header,Footer}.html`
or `GerritSite.css` by the relative URL `static/$name`
(e.g. `static/logo.png`).

To simplify security management, files are only served from
`'$site_path'/static`.  Subdirectories are explicitly forbidden from
being served from this location by enforcing the rule that file names
cannot contain `/` or `\`.  (Client requests for `static/foo/bar`
will result in 404 Not Found responses.)

== HTTP Caching

The header, footer, and CSS files are inlined into the host page,
which is always sent with a no-cache header.  Clients will see any
changes immediately after they are made.

Assets under `'$site_path'/static` whose file name matches one of the
following patterns are served with a 1 year expiration, permitting
very aggressive caching by clients and edge-proxies:

 * `*.cache.html`
 * `*.cache.gif`
 * `*.cache.png`
 * `*.cache.css`
 * `*.cache.jar`
 * `*.cache.swf`

All other assets under `'$site_path'/static` are served with a 5
minute expire, permitting some (limited) caching.  It may take up
to 5 minutes after making a change, before clients see the changes.

It is recommended that static images used in the site header
or footer be named with a unique caching file name, for example
`my_logo1.cache.png`, to allow browsers to take advantage of their
disk cache.  If the image needs to be modified, create a new file,
`my_logo2.cache.png` and update the header (or footer) HTML to
reference the new image path.
