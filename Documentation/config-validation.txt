Gerrit Code Review - Commit Validation
======================================

Gerrit supports link:dev-plugins.html[plugin-based] validation of
commits.

This allows plugins to perform additional validation checks against
new commits, and send back a warning or error message to the git
client.

Validation applies to both commits uploaded via `git push`, and new
commits generated via Web UI features such as the rebase, revert and
cherry-pick buttons.

To make use of this feature, a plugin must implement the `CommitValidationListener`
interface.

Out of the box, Gerrit includes a plugin that checks the length of the
subject and body lines of commit messages on uploaded commits.
