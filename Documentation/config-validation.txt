Gerrit Code Review - Commit Validation
======================================

Gerrit supports link:dev-plugins.html[plugin-based] validation of
commits.

This allows plugins to perform additional validation checks against
commits, and send back a warning or error message to the git client.

New commit validatation
-----------------------


This validation applies to both commits uploaded via `git push`, and new
commits generated via Web UI features such as the rebase, revert and
cherry-pick buttons.

To perform additional validation of new commits, a plugin must implement
the `CommitValidationListener` interface.

Out of the box, Gerrit includes a plugin that checks the length of the
subject and body lines of commit messages on uploaded commits.

Pre-merge validation
--------------------


This validation applies to commits before they are merged to the git
repository.

To provide additional pre-merge validation, a plugin must implement the
`MergeValidationListener` interface.
