Gerrit Code Review - Building with Buck
=======================================

Installation
------------

There is currently no binary distribution of Buck, so it has to be manually
built and installed.  Apache Ant is required.

Clone the git and build it:

----
  git clone https://gerrit.googlesource.com/buck
  cd buck
  ant
----

Add the buck executable's location to the system path:

Linux
~~~~~

----
  PATH="`pwd`/bin:$PATH"
----

Mac OS
~~~~~~

----
  PATH="`pwd`/bin:/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands:$PATH"
----


Eclipse Project
---------------

Generating the Eclipse Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the Eclipse project by building the `eclipse` target:

----
  buck build eclipse
----

In Eclipse, choose 'Import existing project' and select the `gerrit` project
from the current working directory.  Do not import any of the other Maven
based projects.

Expand the `gerrit` project, right-click on the `buck-out` folder, select
'Properties', and then under 'Attributes' check 'Derived'.

Refreshing the Eclipse Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the code doesn't compile and an updated classpath is needed, the configs
can be refreshed and missing dependency JARs can be downloaded by building
the `eclipse_project` and `download` targets:

----
  buck build eclipse_project download
----


Building on the Command Line
----------------------------

Gerrit Development WAR File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the Gerrit web application:

----
  buck build gerrit
----

The output executable WAR will be placed in:

----
  buck-out/gen/gerrit.war
----

Extension and Plugin API JAR Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the extension and plugin API JAR files:

----
  buck build api
----

The output JAR files will be placed in:

----
  buck-out/gen/{extension,plugin}-api.jar
----

Running Unit Tests
------------------

To run all tests including acceptance tests:

----
  buck test --all
----

To exclude slow tests:

----
  buck test --all -e slow
----


Dependencies
------------

Dependency JARs are normally downloaded automatically, but Buck can inspect
its graph and download any missing JAR files.  This is useful to enable
builds to run without network access.

Force a download of dependency JARs by building the `download` target:

----
  buck build download
----
