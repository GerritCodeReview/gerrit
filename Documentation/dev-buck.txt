Gerrit Code Review - Building with Buck
=======================================


Installation
------------

There is currently no binary distribution of Buck, so it has to be manually
built and installed.  Apache Ant is required.

Clone the git and build it:

----
  git clone https://gerrit.googlesource.com/buck
  cd buck
  ant
----

Add the buck executable's location to the system path:


Linux
~~~~~

----
  PATH="`pwd`/bin:$PATH"
----


Mac OS
~~~~~~

----
  PATH="`pwd`/bin:/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands:$PATH"
----


Eclipse Project
---------------


Generating the Eclipse Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the Eclipse project by building the `eclipse` target:

----
  buck build eclipse
----

In Eclipse, choose 'Import existing project' and select the `gerrit` project
from the current working directory.  Do not import any of the other Maven
based projects.

Expand the `gerrit` project, right-click on the `buck-out` folder, select
'Properties', and then under 'Attributes' check 'Derived'.

Refreshing the Eclipse Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the code doesn't compile and an updated classpath is needed, the configs
can be refreshed and missing dependency JARs can be downloaded by building
the `eclipse_project` and `download` targets:

----
  buck build eclipse_project download
----


Building on the Command Line
----------------------------


Gerrit Development WAR File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the Gerrit web application:

----
  buck build gerrit
----

The output executable WAR will be placed in:

----
  buck-out/gen/gerrit.war
----


Extension and Plugin API JAR Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the extension and plugin API JAR files:

----
  buck build api
----

The output JAR files will be placed in:

----
  buck-out/gen/{extension,plugin}-api.jar
----

Running Unit Tests
------------------

To run all tests including acceptance tests:

----
  buck test --all
----

To exclude slow tests:

----
  buck test --all -e slow
----



Dependencies
------------

Dependency JARs are normally downloaded automatically, but Buck can inspect
its graph and download any missing JAR files.  This is useful to enable
builds to run without network access.

Force a download of dependency JARs by building the `download` target:

----
  buck build download
----


Build Process Switch Exit Criteria
----------------------------------

The switch to Buck is an experimental process. Buck will become the
primary build for Gerrit (and link:dev-maven.html[Maven support]
removed) only when the following conditions are met.

1. Windows support.
+
Facebook has an intern who will be working on this (summer 2013).

2. Bootstrap and stable version support.
+
From a fresh Gerrit clone on a machine without Buck (but with some
reasonable subset of Buck's dependencies, e.g. Python 2.7), a new
Gerrit developer should be able to set up and start building with
Buck by running approximately one command. There should also be some
idea of a "stable" version of Buck, even if we just tie our build
to specific known-good SHAs. Binary distributions are another plus,
which I believe the Buck team has planned.

3. Build without Interent access.
+
Currently dependencies are downloaded directly from Maven Central
and Gerrit's Google Cloud Storage bucket. In some environments
build systems do not have direct network access. It must be possible
for a developer to swap out the upstream Maven Central URL with an
internal Maven mirror, or to supply all of the JARs themselves.

4. Shawn's Buck fork merged upstream.
+
Shawn has a link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/buck/+log/github-master..master[fork of Buck]
with some patches necessary to build Gerrit and run its unit tests.
These patches (or their equivilents) must be in the upstream Buck tree.

5. Fix all incidental issues.
+
Things come up that don't work. Martin just ran out of file
descriptors, which sounds like an upstream bug.
+
There should be a consensus that new bugs like this in upstream
Buck are not constantly being introduced.
