= Gerrit Code Review - Building plugins


From build process perspective there are three types of plugins:

* Maven driven
* Bazel tree driven
* Bazel standalone

These types can be combined: if both files in plugin's root directory exist:

* `BUILD`
* `pom.xml`

the plugin can be built with both Bazel and Maven.


== Maven driven build

If plugin contains `pom.xml` file, it can be built with Maven as usually:

----
mvn clean package
----

Exceptions from the rule above:

=== Exception 1:


Plugin's `pom.xml` references snapshot version of plugin API:
`2.8-SNAPSHOT`. In this case there are two possibilities:

* switch to release API. Change plugin API version in `pom.xml` from
  `2.8-SNAPSHOT` to `2.8.1` and repeat step 1 above.
* build and install `SNAPSHOT` version of plugin API in local Maven repository:

----
./tools/maven/api.sh install
----

=== Exception 2:

Plugin's `pom.xml` references other own or foreign (unpublished) libraries or
even other Gerrit plugins. These libraries and/or plugins must be built and
installed in local Maven repository. Clone the related projects and issue

----
mvn install
----

Repeat step 1. above.


== Bazel in tree driven


The fact that plugin contains `BUILD` file doesn't mean that building this
plugin from the plugin directory works. For now it doesn't. Buck in tree driven
means it can only be built from within Gerrit tree. Clone or link the plugin
into gerrit/plugins directory:

----
cd gerrit
bazel build plugins/<plugin-name>:<plugin-name>
----

The output can be normally found in the following directory:

----
bazel-genfiles/plugins/<plugin-name>/<plugin-name>.jar
----

Some plugins describe their build process in `src/main/resources/Documentation/build.md`
file. It may worth checking.

== Bazel standalone driven

Only few plugins support that mode for now:

----
cd reviewers
bazel build reviewers
----
