= Gerrit Code Review - Building plugins


From build process perspective there are three types of plugins:

* Maven driven
* Bazel tree driven
* Bazel standalone

These types can be combined: if both files in plugin's root directory exist:

* `BUILD`
* `pom.xml`

the plugin can be built with both Bazel and Maven.


== Maven driven build

If plugin contains `pom.xml` file, it can be built with Maven as usually:

----
mvn clean package
----

Exceptions from the rule above:

=== Exception 1:


Plugin's `pom.xml` references snapshot version of plugin API:
`2.8-SNAPSHOT`. In this case there are two possibilities:

* switch to release API. Change plugin API version in `pom.xml` from
  `2.8-SNAPSHOT` to `2.8.1` and repeat step 1 above.
* build and install `SNAPSHOT` version of plugin API in local Maven repository:

----
./tools/maven/api.sh install
----

=== Exception 2:

Plugin's `pom.xml` references other own or foreign (unpublished) libraries or
even other Gerrit plugins. These libraries and/or plugins must be built and
installed in local Maven repository. Clone the related projects and issue

----
mvn install
----

Repeat step 1. above.


== Bazel in tree driven


The fact that plugin contains `BUILD` file doesn't mean that building this
plugin from the plugin directory works.

Bazel in tree driven means it can only be built from within Gerrit tree. Clone
or link the plugin into gerrit/plugins directory:

----
cd gerrit
bazel build plugins/<plugin-name>:<plugin-name>
----

The output can be normally found in the following directory:

----
bazel-genfiles/plugins/<plugin-name>/<plugin-name>.jar
----

Some plugins describe their build process in `src/main/resources/Documentation/build.md`
file. It may worth checking.

=== Error Prone checks

Error Prone checks are enabled by default for core Gerrit and all core plugins. To
enable the checks for custom plugins, add it in the `error_prone_packages` group
in `tools/BUILD`.

=== Plugins with external dependencies ===

If the plugin has external dependencies, then they must be included from Gerrit's
own WORKSPACE file. This can be achieved by including them in `external_plugin_deps.bzl`.
During the build in Gerrit tree, this file must be copied over the dummy one in
`plugins` directory.

Example for content of `external_plugin_deps.bzl` file:

----
load("//tools/bzl:maven_jar.bzl", "maven_jar")

def external_plugin_deps():
  maven_jar(
      name = 'org_apache_tika_tika_core',
      artifact = 'org.apache.tika:tika-core:1.12',
      sha1 = '5ab95580d22fe1dee79cffbcd98bb509a32da09b',
  )
----

=== Bundle custom plugin in release.war ===

To bundle custom plugin(s) in the link:dev-bazel.html#release[release.war] artifact,
add them to the CUSTOM_PLUGINS list in `tools/bzl/plugins.bzl`.

Example of `tools/bzl/plugins.bzl` with custom plugin `my-plugin`:

----
CORE_PLUGINS = [
    "commit-message-length-validator",
    "download-commands",
    "hooks",
    "replication",
    "reviewnotes",
    "singleusergroup",
]

CUSTOM_PLUGINS = [
    "my-plugin",
]

CUSTOM_PLUGINS_TEST_DEPS = [
    # Add custom core plugins with tests deps here
]
----

If the plugin(s) being bundled in the release have external dependencies, include them
in `plugins/external_plugin_deps`. Create symbolik link from plugin's own
`external_plugin_deps()` file in plugins directory and prefix the file with
plugin name, e.g.:

----
  $ cd plugins
  $ ln -s ../../oauth/external_plugin_deps.bzl oauth_external_plugin_deps.bzl
  $ ln -s ../../uploadvalidator/external_plugin_deps.bzl uploadvalidator_external_plugin_deps.bzl
----

Now the plugin specific dependency files can be imported:

----
load(":oauth_external_plugin_deps.bzl", oauth_deps="external_plugin_deps")
load(":uploadvalidator_external_plugin_deps.bzl", uploadvalidator_deps="external_plugin_deps")

def external_plugin_deps():
  oauth_deps()
  uploadvalidator_deps()
----

[NOTE]
Since `tools/bzl/plugins.bzl` and `plugins/external_plugin_deps.bzl` are part of
Gerrit's source code and the version of the war is based on the state of the git
repository that is built; you should commit this change before building, otherwise
the version will be marked as 'dirty'.

== Bazel standalone driven

Only few plugins support that mode for now:

----
cd reviewers
bazel build reviewers
