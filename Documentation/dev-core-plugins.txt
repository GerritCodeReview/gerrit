= Gerrit Code Review - Core Plugins

[[definition]]
== What are core plugins?

Core plugins are plugins that are packaged within the Gerrit war file. This
means during the link:pgm-init.html[Gerrit initialization] they can be easily
installed without downloading any additional files.

To make working with core plugins easy, they are linked as
link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/refs/heads/master/.gitmodules[Git
submodules] in the `gerrit` repository. E.g. this means they can be easily
link:dev-readme.html#clone[cloned] together with Gerrit.

All core plugins are developed and maintained by the
link:dev-roles.html#maintainers[Gerrit maintainers] and everyone can
link:dev-contributing.html[contribute] to them.

Adding a new core plugin feature that is large or complex requires a
link:dev-design-doc.html[design doc] (also see
link:dev-contributing.html#design-driven-contribution-process[design-driven
contribution process]). The link:dev-processes.html#steering-committee[
engineering steering committee (ESC)] is the authority that approves the design
docs. The ESC is also in charge of adding and removing core plugins.

Non-Gerrit maintainers cannot have link:access-control.html#category_owner[
Owner] permissions for core plugins.
