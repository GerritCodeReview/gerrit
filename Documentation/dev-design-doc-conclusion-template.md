# Conclusion

Describe which decision was made and what were the reasons for it.

## <a id="implementation-plan"> Implementation Plan

If known, say who is driving the implementation, for when the
implementation is planned and which priority it has.

It is possible to contribute designs without having resources to do the
implementation. In this case, say so here.

If mentor support is desired, say so here. Also briefly describe any
circumstances that can help with finding a suitable mentor.

## <a id="time-estimation"> Time Estimation

A rough itemized estimation of how much time it takes to implement this
feature. Break down the feature into work items and estimate each item
separately.

If a mentor is assigned, this section must define a maximum time frame
after which the mentorship automatically ends even if the feature isn't
fully done yet.
