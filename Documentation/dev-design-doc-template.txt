[[objective]]
== Objective

In a few sentences, describe the key system objectives. Define the
goals and non-goals.

[[background]]
== Background

Stuff one needs to know to understand this doc (e.g. motivating
examples, previous versions and problems, links to related
changes/design docs, etc.

Note: this is background; do not write about your design or ideas to
solve problems here.

[[overview]]
== Overview

High-level overview; put details in the next section and background in
the previous section. Should be understandable by engineers that are
not working on Gerrit.

[[detailed-design]]
== Detailed Design

How does the overall design work? Details about the algorithms,
storage format, APIs, etc., should be included here.

It is ok for this to lack in detail at first for initial review.

[[alternatives-considered]]
== Alternatives Considered

You may need to describe what you did not do or why simpler approaches
don't work. Mention other things to watch out for (if any).

[[implemenation-plan]]
== Implementation Plan

If known, say who is driving the implementation, for when the
implementation is planned and which priority it has for you.

It is possible to contribute designs without having resources to do the
implementation. In this case, say so here.
