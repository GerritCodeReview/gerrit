# Use Cases

In a few sentences, describe the use-cases as interactions between a
user and a system to attain particular goals.

Should be understandable by anyone who is familiar with using Gerrit.

Optionally, define non-goals.

It is possible that use-cases are specific to custom setups (e.g. the
multi-master setup at Google). In this case, say so here.

## <a id="acceptance-criteria"> Acceptance Criteria

Describe conditions that must be satisfied to consider the feature as
done.

If a mentor is assigned, the mentorship ends when this state is reached.
Please note that a mentorship can also end earlier if the maximum time
frame for the mentorship has exceeded (see section 'Time Estimation'
in dev-design-doc-conclusion-template.txt).

## <a id="background"> Background

Stuff one needs to know to understand the use-cases (e.g. motivating
examples, previous versions and problems, links to related
changes/design docs, etc.).

Note: this is background; do not write about your design or ideas to
solve problems here.
