= Gerrit Code Review - Design Docs

For the link:dev-contributing.html#design-driven-contribution-process[
design-driven contribution process] it is required to specify features
upfront in a design doc.

[[propose]]
== How to propose a new design?

To propose a new design, add a `design-${title}.txt` file to this
folder and push it as change for review. The design doc should follow
the structure of the link:dev-design-doc-template.html[design doc
template] and the change should be marked with the hashtag
`design-doc`.

Pushing a design doc for review requires to be a
link:dev-roles.html#contributor[contributor].

When contributing design docs, contributors should make clear whether
they are committed to do the implementation. It is possible to
contribute designs without having resources to do the implementation,
but in this case the implementation is only done if someone volunteers
to do it (which is not guaranteed to happen).

[[review]]
== Design doc review

Everyone in the link:dev-roles.html[Gerrit community] is welcome to
take part in the design review and comment on the design.

Changes with new design docs should stay open for a minimum of 10
calendar days so that everyone has a fair chance to see them. It is
important that concerns regarding a feature are raised during this time
frame since once a design is approved and submitted the implementation
may start immediately.

Within the 10 calendar days time frame, the contributor should hear back
from the link:dev-processes.html#steering-committee[engineering steering committee]
whether the proposed feature is in scope of the project and if it can
be accepted.

In order to be accepted/submitted, it is not necessary that the design
doc fully specifies all the details, but the idea of the feature and
how it fits into Gerrit should be sufficiently clear (judged by the
engineering steering committee). Contributors are expected to keep the design doc
updated and fill in gaps while they go forward with the implementation.
