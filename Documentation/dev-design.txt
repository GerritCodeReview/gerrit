= Gerrit Code Review - System Design

== Objective

Gerrit is a web based code review system, facilitating online code
reviews for projects using the Git version control system.

Gerrit makes reviews easier by showing changes in a side-by-side
display, and allowing inline/file comments to be added by any reviewer.

Gerrit simplifies Git based project maintainership by permitting
any authorized user to submit changes to the master Git repository,
rather than requiring all approved changes to be merged in by
hand by the project maintainer.  This functionality enables a more
centralized usage of Git.


== Background

Git is a distributed version control system, wherein each repository
is assumed to be owned/maintained by a single user.  There are no
inherent security controls built into Git, so the ability to read
from or write to a repository is controlled entirely by the host's
filesystem access controls.  When multiple maintainers collaborate
on a single shared repository a high degree of trust is required,
as any collaborator with write access can alter the repository.

The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) was founded by Google by the
open source releasing of the Android operating system. AOSP has
selected Git as its primary version control tool. As many of the
engineers had a background of using code review at Google there was a
desire to have a powerful code review tool available for Git and AOSP,
analogous to Google's internal tools.

Gerrit Code Review started as a simple set of patches to Rietveld, a
code review system originally built as a technology demo of Google's
appengine platform. Gerrit was originally built to service AOSP. This
quickly turned into a fork as access control features were rejected
for the Rietveld code base. As the functionality and code were
starting to become drastically different, a different name was needed.
Gerrit calls back to the original namesake of Rietveld, Gerrit
Rietveld, a Dutch architect.

Gerrit 2.x is a complete rewrite of the Gerrit fork, completely
changing the implementation from Python on Google App Engine, to Java
on a J2EE servlet container. Since Gerrit 3.x
link:note-db.html[NoteDb] replaced the SQL database and all metadata
is now stored in Git.


== Overview

Developers create one or more changes on their local desktop system,
then upload them for review to Gerrit using the standard `git push`
command line program, or any GUI which can invoke `git push` on
behalf of the user.  Authentication and data transfer are handled
through SSH.  Users are authenticated by username and public/private
key pair, and all data transfer is protected by the SSH connection
and Git's own data integrity checks.

Each Git commit created on the client desktop system is converted
into a unique change record which can be reviewed independently.
Change records are stored in NoteDb.

A summary of each newly uploaded change is automatically emailed
to reviewers, so they receive a direct hyperlink to review the
change on the web.  Reviewer email addresses can be specified on the
`git push` command line, but typically reviewers are automatically
selected by Gerrit by identifying users who have change approval
permissions in the project.

Reviewers use the web interface to read the side-by-side or unified
diff of a change, and insert draft inline/file comments where
appropriate. A draft comment is visible only to the reviewer, until
they publish those comments.  Published comments are automatically
emailed to the change author by Gerrit, and are CC'd to all other
reviewers who have already commented on the change.

When publishing comments reviewers are also given the opportunity
to score the change, indicating whether they feel the change is
ready for inclusion in the project, needs more work, or should be
rejected outright.  These scores provide direct feedback to Gerrit's
change submit function.

After a change has been scored positively by reviewers, Gerrit
enables a submit button on the web interface.  Authorized users
can push the submit button to have the change enter the project
repository.  The equivalent in Subversion or Perforce would be
that Gerrit is invoking `svn commit` or `p4 submit` on behalf of
the web user pressing the button.  Due to the way Git audit trails
are maintained, the user pressing the submit button does not need
to be the author of the change.


== Infrastructure

End-user web browsers make HTTP requests directly to Gerrit's
HTTP server.  As nearly all of the user interface is implemented
through PolyGerrit, the majority of these requests are transmitting
compressed JSON payloads, with all HTML being generated within the
browser.  Most responses are under 1 KB.

Gerrit's HTTP server side component is implemented as a standard
Java servlet, and thus runs within any J2EE servlet container.
Popular choices for deployments would be Tomcat or Jetty, as these
are high-quality open-source servlet containers that are readily
available for download.

End-user uploads are performed over SSH or HTTP, so Gerrit's servlets
also start up a background thread to receive SSH connections through
an independent SSH port. SSH clients communicate directly with this
port, bypassing the HTTP server used by browsers.

Server side data storage for Gerrit is broken down into two different
categories:

* Git repository data
* Gerrit metadata

The Git repository data is the Git object database used to store
already submitted revisions, as well as all uploaded (proposed)
changes.  Gerrit uses the standard Git repository format, and
therefore requires direct filesystem access to the repositories.
All repository data is stored in the filesystem and accessed through
the JGit library.  Repository data can be stored on remote servers
accessible through NFS or SMB, but the remote directory must
be mounted on the Gerrit server as part of the local filesystem
namespace.  Remote filesystems are likely to perform worse than
local ones, due to Git disk IO behavior not being optimized for
remote access.

The Gerrit metadata contains a summary of the available changes, all
comments (published and drafts), and individual user account
information.

Gerrit metadata is also stored in a Git, with the commits serving
marking historical state of metadata. Data is stored in the trees
associated with the commits, typically using Git config file or JSON
as the base format.

User authentication is handled by identity Realms. Gerrit supports the
following types of authentication:

* OpenId (see link:http://openid.net/developers/specs/[OpenID Specifications,role=external,window=_blank])
* OAuth
* LDAP
* Google accounts (on googlesource.com)


== Internationalization and Localization

As a source code review system for open source projects, where the
commonly preferred language for communication is typically English,
Gerrit does not make internationalization or localization a priority.

The majority of Gerrit's users will be writing change descriptions
and comments in English, and therefore an English user interface
is usable by the target user base.


== Accessibility Considerations

Whenever possible Gerrit displays raw text rather than image icons,
so screen readers should still be able to provide useful information
to blind persons accessing Gerrit sites.

Standard HTML hyperlinks are used rather than HTML div or span tags
with click listeners.  This provides two benefits to the end-user.
The first benefit is that screen readers are optimized to locating
standard hyperlink anchors and presenting them to the end-user as
a navigation action.  The second benefit is that users can use
the 'open in new tab/window' feature of their browser whenever
they choose.

When possible, Gerrit uses the ARIA properties on DOM widgets to
provide hints to screen readers.


== Browser Compatibility

Gerrit requires a JavaScript enabled browser.

As Gerrit is a pure JavaScript application on the client side, with
no server side rendering fallbacks, the browser must support modern
JavaScript semantics in order to access the Gerrit web application.
Dumb clients such as `lynx`, `wget`, `curl`, or even many search engine
spiders are not able to access Gerrit content.

All of the content stored within Gerrit is also available through
other means, such as gitweb or the `git://` protocol. Any existing
search engine crawlers can index the server-side HTML produced by
gitweb, and thus can index the majority of the changes which might
appear in Gerrit. Some engines may even choose to crawl the native
version control database, such as ohloh.net does. Therefore the lack
of support for most search engine crawlers is a non-issue for most
Gerrit deployments.


== Product Integration

Gerrit integrates with repository viewers by optionally creating
hyperlinks to reference changes on the gitweb server. It also comes
with a built-in code browser, called Gitiles.

Gerrit integrates with some types of corporate single-sign-on (SSO)
solutions, typically by having the SSO authentication be performed
in a reverse proxy web server and then blindly trusting that all
incoming connections have been authenticated by that reverse proxy.
When configured to use this form of authentication, Gerrit does
not integrate with OpenID providers.

When installing Gerrit, administrators may optionally include an
HTML header or footer snippet which may include user tracking code,
such as that used by Google Analytics.  This is a per-instance
configuration that must be done by hand, and is not supported
out of the box.  Other site trackers instead of Google Analytics
can be used, as the administrator can supply any HTML/JavaScript
they choose.

Gerrit does not integrate with any Google service, or any other
services other than those listed above.

== Privacy Considerations

Gerrit stores the following information per user account:

* Full Name
* Preferred Email Address

The full name and preferred email address fields are shown to any
site visitor viewing a page containing a change uploaded by the
account owner, or containing a published comment written by the
account owner.

Showing the full name and preferred email is approximately the same
risk as the `From` header of an email posted to a public mailing
list that maintains archives, and Gerrit treats these fields in
much the same way that a mailing list archive might handle them.
Users who don't want to expose this information should either not
participate in a Gerrit based online community, or open a new email
address dedicated for this use.

As the Gerrit UI data is only available through XSRF protected
JSON-RPC calls, "screen-scraping" for email addresses is difficult,
but not impossible.  It is unlikely a spammer will go through the
effort required to code a custom scraping application necessary
to cull email addresses from published Gerrit comments.  In most
cases these same addresses would be more easily obtained from the
project's mailing list archives.

The user's name and email address is stored unencrypted in the
link:config-accounts.html#all-users[All-Users] repository.

== Spam and Abuse Considerations

Gerrit makes no attempt to detect spam changes or comments.  The
somewhat high barrier to entry makes it unlikely that a spammer
will target Gerrit.

To upload a change, the client must speak the native Git protocol
embedded in SSH, with some custom Gerrit semantics added on top.
The client must have their public key already stored in the Gerrit
database, which can only be done through the XSRF protected
JSON-RPC interface.  The level of effort required to construct
the necessary tools to upload a well-formatted change that isn't
rejected outright by the Git and Gerrit checksum validations is
too high to for a spammer to get any meaningful return.

To post and publish a comment a client must sign in with an OpenID
provider and then use the XSRF protected JSON-RPC interface to
publish the draft on an existing change record.  Again, the level of
effort required to implement the Gerrit specific XSRF protections
and the JSON-RPC payload format necessary to post a draft and then
publish that draft is simply too high for a spammer to bother with.

Both of these assumptions are also based upon the idea that Gerrit
will be a lot less popular than blog software, and thus will be
running on a lot fewer websites.  Spammers therefore have very little
returned benefit for getting over the protocol hurdles.

These assumptions may need to be revisited in the future if any
public Gerrit site actually notices spam.


== Latency

Gerrit targets for sub-250 ms per page request, mostly by using
very compact JSON payloads between client and server.  However, as
most of the serving stack (network, hardware, metadata
database) is out of control of the Gerrit developers, no real
guarantees can be made about latency.


== Scalability

Gerrit is designed for a very large scale open source project, or
large commercial development project.  Roughly this amounts to
parameters such as the following:

.Design Parameters
[options="header"]
|======================================================
|Parameter        | Default Maximum | Estimated Maximum
|Projects         |         1,000   |  10,000
|Contributors     |         1,000   | 100,000
|Changes/Day      |           100   |   2,000
|Revisions/Change |            20   |      20
|Files/Change     |            50   | 500,000
|Comments/File    |           100   |     100
|Reviewers/Change |             8   |       8
|======================================================

Out of the box, Gerrit will handle the "Default Maximum". Site
administrators may reconfigure their servers by editing gerrit.config
to run closer to the estimated maximum if sufficient memory is made
available to the JVM and the relevant cache.*.memoryLimit variables
are increased from their defaults.



=== CPU Usage - Git over SSH/HTTP

A 24 core server is able to handle ~25 concurrent `git fetch`
operations per second. The issue here is each concurrent operation
demands one full core, as the computation is almost entirely server
side CPU bound. 25 concurrent operations is known to be sufficient to
support hundreds of active developers and 50 automated build servers
polling for updates and building every change.  (This data was derived
from an actual installation's performance.)

Because of the distributed nature of Git, end-users don't need to
contact the central Gerrit Code Review server very often. For `git
fetch` traffic, link:pgm-daemon.html[replica mode] is known to be an
effective way to offload traffic from the main server, permitting it
to scale to a large user base without needing an excessive number of
cores in a single system.

Clients on very slow network connections (for example home office
users on VPN over home DSL) may be network bound rather than server
side CPU bound, in which case a core may be effectively shared with
another user. Possible core sharing due to network bottlenecks
generally holds true for network connections running below 10 MiB/sec.

If the server's own network interface is 1 Gib/sec (Gigabit Ethernet),
the system can really only serve about 10 concurrent clients at the
10 MiB/sec speed, no matter how many cores it has.


== Redundancy & Reliability

Gerrit largely assumes that the local filesystem where Git repository
data is stored is always available.  Important data written to disk
is also forced to the platter with an `fsync()` once it has been
fully written.  If the local filesystem fails to respond to reads
or becomes corrupt, Gerrit has no provisions to fallback or retry
and errors will be returned to clients.

Due to the relatively small scale described above, it is very likely
that the Git filesystem and metadata database are all housed on the
same server that is running Gerrit.  If any failure arises in one of
these components, it is likely to manifest in the others too.  It is
also likely that the administrator cannot be bothered to deploy a
cluster of load-balanced server hardware, as the scale and expected
load does not justify the hardware or management costs.

Most deployments caring about reliability will setup a warm-spare
standby system and use a manual fail-over process to switch from the
failed system to the warm-spare.

As Git is a distributed version control system, and open source
projects tend to have contributors from all over the world, most
contributors will be able to tolerate a Gerrit down time of several
hours while the administrator is notified, signs on, and brings the
warm-spare up.  Pending changes are likely to need at least 24 hours
of time on the Gerrit site anyway in order to ensure any interested
parties around the world have had a chance to comment.  This expected
lag largely allows for some downtime in a disaster scenario.

=== Backups

Using the standard replication plugin, Gerrit can be configured
to replicate changes made to the local Git repositories over any
standard Git transports. After the plugin is installed, remote
destinations can be configured in `'$site_path'/etc/replication.conf`
to send copies of all changes over SSH to other servers, or to the
Amazon S3 blob storage service.


== Logging Plan

Gerrit does not maintain logs on its own.

Published comments contain a publication date, so users can judge
when the comment was posted and decide if it was "recent" or not.
Only the timestamp is stored in the database, the IP address of
the comment author is not stored.

Changes uploaded over the SSH daemon from `git push` have the
standard Git reflog updated with the date and time that the upload
occurred, and the Gerrit account identity of who did the upload.
Changes submitted and merged into a branch also update the
Git reflog.  These logs are available only to the Gerrit site
administrator, and they are not replicated through the automatic
replication noted earlier.  These logs are primarily recorded for an
"oh s**t" moment where the administrator has to rewind data.  In most
installations they are a waste of disk space.  Future versions of
JGit may allow disabling these logs, and Gerrit may take advantage
of that feature to stop writing these logs.

A web server positioned in front of Gerrit (such as a reverse proxy)
or the hosting servlet container may record access logs, and these
logs may be mined for usage information.  This is outside of the
scope of Gerrit.
