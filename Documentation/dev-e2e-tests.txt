= Gerrit Code Review - End to end load tests

This document describes how to collect client side metrics when load testing Gerrit.

The example scenarios are based on the link:http://gatling.io[`Gatling`] framework.

Gatling is a load testing tool which provides a bit out of the box support for the HTTP protocol.
However the proposed scenarios show how to run tests using the Git protocol as well.

Gatling is written in Scala, but the abstraction provided by the Gatling DSL makes
the scenarios implementation easy even without any Scala knowledge.

Examples can be found in the `e2e-tests` directory.
