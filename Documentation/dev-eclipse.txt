Gerrit2 - Eclipse Setup
=======================

This document is about installing Gerrit into an Eclipse workspace
for development and debugging, especially with the GWT hosted
mode debugger.

You will need to have the GWT (Google Web Toolkit) SDK installed on
your system.  A Java 5 or later SDK is also required to run GWT's
compiler and runtime.

GWT requires the Sun JDK (or OpenJDK).  The GWT "hosted mode"
environment (Eclipse debugger or "make web-shell") does not work
under libgcj.


User Library
------------

Create a user library called `GWT`:

* Window > Preferences
* Java > Build Path > User Libraries

* New
* Name: `GWT`
* Add JARs...

* Select `gwt-user.jar` from the $(GWT_SDK) directory.
* Select `gwt-dev-$(OS).jar` from the $(GWT_SDK) directory.

Maven Plugin
------------

Install the Maven Integration plugins:

http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/[m2eclipse]


Pre-Build
---------

Ensure jgit has been installed in your maven repository:

====
  (cd ../jgit/jgit-maven/jgit/ && mvn install)
====

Ensure mina_sshd has been installed in your maven repository:

====
  (cd ../mina_sshd/ && mvn install)
====


Import Projects
---------------

Import pom.xml using General -> Maven Projects

If you also want source projects for gwtorm, gwtjsonrpc or mina_sshd,
import their top-level directories the same way.  Note that you
may need to edit the pom.xml under gerrit to ensure your snapshot
builds are used.

[NOTE]
If you import gwtorm, you also need to right click on `gwtorm`,
Maven -> Update Project Configuration to force a compile of
the generted ANTLR sources.  This should fix the compile errors
identified after import.

If you also want a source project for JGit, import the top level
jgit directory using General -> Existing Projects, selecting only
the `org.spearce.jgit` and `org.spearce.jgit.test` projects.


Configure Database
------------------

You may have already done this step earlier, based on the
instructions in link:dev-readme.html[Developer Setup].

* Open gerrit-webapp/src/main/java
* Copy `GerritServer.properties_example` to `GerritServer.properties`
* Configure your database for debugging in hosted mode.


Launch Gerrit
-------------

Open Run->Debug Configurations... 

Under Java Application find `gerrit_debug` (not Mac OS X)
or `gerrit_macos` (Mac OS X only) to start the GWT hosted
mode browser and debug through Eclipse.
