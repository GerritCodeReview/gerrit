Gerrit Code Review - Building with Maven
========================================

[[eclipse]]
Eclipse Integration
-------------------

Installing the Maven Integration Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Eclipse version 3.7 (Indigo) and later, these are available in the
default update site and can be found under the 'Collaboration' category.

For older versions the update site must be manually added; the link can
be found on the http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/download/[m2eclipse download page].

Importing Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import the projects into Eclipse by going to File -> Import... -> Maven ->
Existing Maven Projects and selecting the directory containing pom.xml.

Some of the source code is generated with ANTLR sources.  To build
these files, right click on the imported projects, Maven -> Update
Project Configuration.  This will resolve compile errors identified
after import.


[[build]]
Building on the Command Line
----------------------------

Gerrit Development WAR File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the WAR file from the command line:

----
  mvn clean package
----

The output executable WAR will be placed in:

----
  gerrit-war/target/gerrit-*.war
----

Running Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the build will run the unit tests.

To build without tests:

----
  mvn clean package -DskipTests
----

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the build will generate and include the documentation.

To build without documentation:

----
  mvn clean package -Dgerrit.documentation.skip
----
