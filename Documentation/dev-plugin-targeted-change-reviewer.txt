Gerrit Code Review - Targeted Change Reviewers
==============================================

Gerrit supports plugins based on the `TargetedChangeReviewers` interface. The
infrastructure allows plugins to add targeted change reviewers (e.g.,
most popular approvers for a specific branch) to the top of the suggested
reviewers dropdown list or to display them when the reviewer text box gets
focus.

The `TargetedChangeReviewer` interface is located in SuggestReviewers.java.
The interface also contains a factory.  Any plugin that implements this interface
will need to implement both `TargetedChangeReviewers` and its factory. The plugin
will need to be bound as a DynamicItem of `TargetedChangeReviewer` factory.  This
implies that, if more than one targeted reviewer plugin is needed, they will
need to be created in series and the first plugin in the series should control
the return of the other plugins.

Plugins that use this interface will return a list of `ReviewerInfo` objects.

A `ReviewerInfo` object may be created as a separator or marked as a separator.
When a `ReviewerInfo` is a separator all other fields it may contain are ignored.
The `SuggestOracle` will add dashes when it encounters a separator to
separate the targeted reviewers from the general reviewers (the reviewers who
are returned as a result of what the user typed in the suggestion textbox).

The plugin should assign each ReviewerInfo object an annotation.  This will help
identify what the reviewer is being targeted for.  No other annotations will be
added to the targeted reviewers by the `SuggestServiceImpl` class.
