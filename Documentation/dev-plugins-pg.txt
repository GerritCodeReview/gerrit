== Plugin loading and initialization

link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/js-api.html#_entry_point[Entry point] for the plugin and the loading method is based on link:http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/[HTML Imports] spec.

* Plugin provides index.html, similar to link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-plugins.html#deployment[.js Web UI plugins]
* index.html contains a `dom-module` tag with a script that uses `Gerrit.install()`.
* PolyGerrit imports index.html along with all required resources defined in it (fonts, styles, etc)
* For standalone plugins, the entry point file is a `pluginname.html` file located in `gerrit-site/plugins` folder, where pluginname is an alphanumeric plugin name.

Here's a sample `myplugin.html`:

``` html
<dom-module id="my-plugin">
  <script>
    Gerrit.install(function() { console.log('Ready.'); });
  </script>
</dom-module>
```
