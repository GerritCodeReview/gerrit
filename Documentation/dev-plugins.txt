Gerrit Code Review - Plugin Development
=======================================

A plugin in gerrit is tightly coupled code that runs in the same
JVM as gerrit. It has full access to all gerrit internals. Plugins
are coupled to a specific major.minor gerrit version.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

To start development, you may download the sample maven project, which downloads
the following dependencies;

* gerrit-sdk.jar file that matches the war file you are developing against


Manifest
--------

Plugins need to include the following data in the jar manifest file;
Gerrit-Plugin = plugin_name
Gerrit-Module = pkg.class

SSH Commands
------------

You may develop plugins which provide commands that can be accessed through the SSH interface.
These commands register themselves as a part of SSH Commands (link).

Each of your plugins commands needs to extend BaseCommand.

Any plugin which implements at least one ssh command needs to also provide a class which extends
the PluginCommandModule in order to register the ssh command(s) in its configure method which you
must override.

Registering is done by calling the command(String commandName).to(ClassName<? extends BaseCommand> klass)
