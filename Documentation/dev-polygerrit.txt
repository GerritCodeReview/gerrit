== Configuring

By default both GWT and PolyGerrit UI are enabled.

To disable GWT but not PolyGerrit:
----
[gerrit]
        enableGwtUi = false
        enablePolyGerrit = true
----

To enable GWT but not PolyGerrit:
----
[gerrit]
        enableGwtUi = true
        enablePolyGerrit = false
----

To enable the PolyGerrit UI you have to add `?polygerrit=1` in the URL.

for example https://gerrit.example.org/?polygerrit=1

To disable PolyGerrit UI, change 1 to 0, which will take you back to GWT UI.
