= Making a Snapshot Release of JGit

This step is only necessary if we need to create an unofficial JGit
snapshot release and publish it to the
link:https://developers.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage,role=external,window=_blank].

[[prepare-environment]]
== Prepare the Maven Environment

First, make sure you have done the necessary
link:dev-release-deploy-config.html#deploy-configuration-settings-xml[
configuration in Maven `settings.xml`].

To apply the necessary settings in JGit's `pom.xml`, follow the instructions
in link:dev-release-deploy-config.html#deploy-configuration-subprojects[
Configuration for Subprojects in `pom.xml`], or apply the provided diff by
executing the following command in the JGit workspace:

----
  git apply /path/to/gerrit/tools/jgit-snapshot-deploy-pom.diff
----

[[prepare-release]]
== Prepare the Release

Since JGit has its own release process we do not push any release tags. Instead
we will use the output of `git describe` as the version of the current JGit
snapshot.

In the JGit workspace, execute the following command:

----
  ./tools/version.sh --release $(git describe)
----

[[publish-release]]
== Publish the Release

To deploy the new snapshot, execute the following command in the JGit
workspace:

----
  mvn deploy
----
