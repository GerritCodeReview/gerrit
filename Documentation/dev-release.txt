= Making a Gerrit Release

[NOTE]
========================================================================
This document is meant primarily for Gerrit maintainers
who have been given approval and submit status to the Gerrit
projects.  Additionally, maintainers should be given owner
status to the Gerrit web site.
========================================================================

To make a Gerrit release involves a great deal of complex
tasks and it is easy to miss a step so this document should
hopefully serve as both a how to for those new to the process
and as a checklist for those already familiar with these
tasks.


== Gerrit Release Type

Here are some guidelines on release approaches depending on the
type of release you want to make (`stable-fix`, `stable`, `RC0`,
`RC1`...).

[[stable]]
=== Stable

A `stable` release is generally built from the `master` branch and may
need to undergo some stabilization before releasing the final release.

* Propose the release with any plans/objectives to the mailing list

* Create a Gerrit `RC0`

* If needed create a Gerrit `RC1`

[NOTE]
========================================================================
You may let in a few features to this release
========================================================================

* If needed create a Gerrit `RC2`

[NOTE]
========================================================================
There should be no new features in this release, only bug fixes
========================================================================

* Finally create the `stable` release (no `RC`)


=== Stable-Fix

`stable-fix` releases should likely only contain bug fixes and doc
updates.

* Propose the release with any plans/objectives to the mailing list

* This type of release does not need any RCs, release when the
objectives are met


[[security]]
=== Security-Fix

`security-fix` releases should only contain bug fixes for security
issues.

For security issues it is important that they are only announced
*after* fixed versions for all relevant releases have been published.
Because of this, `security-fix` releases can't be prepared in the public
`gerrit` project.

`security-fix` releases are prepared in the `gerrit-security-fixes`
project which is only readable by the Gerrit Maintainers. Only after
a `security-fix` release has been published will the commits/tags made in
the `gerrit-security-fixes` project be taken over into the public
`gerrit` project.


== Create the Actual Release

To create a Gerrit release the following steps have to be done:

. link:#subproject[Release Subprojects]
. link:#build-gerrit[Build the Gerrit Release]
. link:#publish-gerrit[Publish the Gerrit Release]
.. link:#extension-and-plugin-api[Publish the Extension and Plugin API Jars]
.. link:#publish-gerrit-war[Publish the Gerrit WAR (with Core Plugins)]
.. link:#push-stable[Push the Stable Branch]
.. link:#push-tag[Push the Release Tag]
.. link:#upload-documentation[Upload the Documentation]
.. link:#update-issues[Update the Issues]
.. link:#announce[Announce on Mailing List]
. link:#increase-version[Increase Gerrit Version for Current Development]
. link:#merge-stable[Merge `stable` into `master`]


[[subproject]]
=== Release Subprojects

The subprojects to be released are:

* `gwtjsonrpc`
* `gwtorm`
* `prolog-cafe`

For each subproject do:

* Check the dependency to the Subproject in the Gerrit parent `pom.xml`:
+
If a `SNAPSHOT` version of the subproject is referenced the subproject
needs to be released so that Gerrit can reference a released version of
the subproject.

* link:dev-release-subproject.html#make-snapshot[Make a snapshot and test it]
* link:dev-release-subproject.html#prepare-release[Prepare the Release]
* link:dev-release-subproject.html#publish-release[Publish the Release]

* Update the `id`, `bin_sha1`, and `src_sha1` values in the `maven_jar`
for the Subproject in `/lib/BUCK` to the released version.


[[build-gerrit]]
=== Build Gerrit

* Build the Gerrit WAR and API JARs
+
----
  buck build release
  buck build api_install
----

* Sanity check WAR
* Test the new Gerrit version

[[publish-gerrit]]
=== Publish the Gerrit Release


[[extension-and-plugin-api]]
==== Publish the Extension and Plugin API Jars

* Make sure you have done the
link:dev-release-deploy-config.html#deploy-configuration-settings-xml[
configuration needed for deployment]

* Push the Jars to the storage bucket:
+
----
  buck build api_deploy
----


[[publish-gerrit-war]]
==== Publish the Gerrit WAR (with Core Plugins)

* The WAR file to upload is `buck-out/gen/release.war`
* Upload WAR to the storage bucket via `https://cloud.google.com/console` (manual via web browser)
* Push the WAR file to the Maven storage bucket:
+
----
  buck build war_deploy
----



[[push-stable]]
==== Push the Stable Branch

* create the stable branch `stable-2.5` in the `gerrit` project
+
Via the link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/gerrit,branches[
Gerrit Web UI] or by push.

* Push the commits done on `stable-2.5` to `refs/for/stable-2.5` and
get them merged


[[push-tag]]
==== Push the Release Tag

* Push the new Release Tag
+
For an `RC`:
+
----
  git push gerrit-review refs/tags/v2.5-rc0:refs/tags/v2.5-rc0
----
+
For a final `stable` release:
+
----
  git push gerrit-review refs/tags/v2.5:refs/tags/v2.5
----


[[upload-documentation]]
==== Upload the Documentation

Build the release notes:

----
  make -C ReleaseNotes
----

* Upload html files to the storage bucket via `https://cloud.google.com/console` (manual via web browser)
** Documentation html files must be extracted from `buck-out/gen/Documentation/html.zip`
* Update Google Code project links
** Go to http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/admin
** Update the documentation link in the `Resources` section of the
Description text, and in the `Links` section.
** Add a link to the new release notes in the `News` section of the
Description text

[[update-issues]]
==== Update the Issues

====
 How do the issues get updated?  Do you run a script to do
 this?  When do you do it, after the final 2.5 is released?
====

By hand.

Our current process is an issue should be updated to say `Status =
Submitted, FixedIn-2.5` once the change is submitted, but before the
release.

After the release is actually made, you can search in Google Code for
``Status=Submitted FixedIn=2.5'' and then batch update these changes
to say `Status=Released`. Make sure the pulldown says ``All Issues''
because `Status=Submitted` is considered a closed issue.


[[announce]]
==== Announce on Mailing List

* Send an email to the mailing list to announce the release, consider
including some or all of the following in the email:
** A link to the release and the release notes (if a final release)
** A link to the docs
** Describe the type of release (stable, bug fix, RC)

[[increase-version]]
=== Increase Gerrit Version for Current Development

All new development that is done in the `master` branch will be
included in the next Gerrit release. Update the Gerrit version in the
`VERSION` file, and plugin archetypes' `pom.xml` files. Push the change
for review and get it merged.


[[merge-stable]]
=== Merge `stable` into `master`

After every release, stable should be merged to master to ensure that
none of the changes/fixes ever get lost.

----
  git config merge.summary true
  git checkout master
  git reset --hard origin/master
  git branch -f stable origin/stable
  git merge stable
