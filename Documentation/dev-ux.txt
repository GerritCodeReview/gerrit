= Gerrit Code Review - UX Guideline

Even though Gerrit is a tool which is mostly used by developers, usability is an
aspect which shouldn't be dismissed. Having a tool which is easy, intuitively
and efficient to use, can be a great benefit and avoid a lot of frustration and
waste of time. That's why we should strive to create one. This section mentions
some aspects which we should respect in order to achieve a good usability for
Gerrit.

== Guiding the user
* Further contextual information must be provided via tooltips, descriptions, or
additional context for all functionality which is not easily understood.
* Every disabled control must have a tooltip indicating why this control is
disabled.
* Actions which are important for a specific workflow on a specific view must
stand out. This includes that users can notice those actions as soon as they
enter this view without any further interactions.
* All UI elements should be close to the context they belong to. For instance,
a control which changes the presentation of some part of the UI should be
closely placed to that part.
* Naming should be consistent throughout the UI. A concept for which some part
of the UI uses a specific name must not be called by another name at another
part.
* The phrasing and format of any text should be consistent for similar UI
elements throughout the UI.
* Sentence case should be used for all actions.
* If possible, domain specific names should be used. For instance, an action
which is based on a publicly known Git command should not be named differently.

== Avoiding frustration
* Whenever a process triggered by a user is in progress, this must be indicated
to the user. For instance, areas of the UI which haven't finished loading must
indicate so.
* Users should get as much feedback as possible while waiting for the result of
an action they triggered. If partial results can be provided, they should be
shown to the user as early as possible.
* If using a control causes irreversible data loss in Gerrit or the underlying
Git repository, a confirmation dialog must be displayed prior to executing
the requested action. For instance, deleting a Gerrit change should only be
executed after the user issued the deletion and confirmed that they definitely
want to delete the change.
* Actions causing irreversible data loss should be limited to the absolute
necessary ones. If possible, undo functionality should be provided for them.
* User actions which only change what is presented on the UI or in which way it
is presented must be reversible. This means that a user can return to the
previous view whenever they want.
* Standard UI elements shouldn't be used in a way which goes against Google
design standards. If users expect a specific effect because they use a specific
kind of control, the use of it should not result in a completely different
effect. For instance, a link representing a primary, non-navigational action
would go against user expectations.
* In general, the UI should be designed according to the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment[principle of least
astonishment].
* At any point in time, users should never be negatively surprised by anything.
* Whenever possible, the UI should be designed in such a way that users can't
do anything wrong unintentionally. As that's not always possible, the UI should
at least prevent users as much as possible from doing something wrong.
