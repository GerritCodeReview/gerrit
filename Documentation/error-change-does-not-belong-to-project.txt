change ... does not belong to project ...
=========================================

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit to a change
that belongs to another project.

This error message means that the user explicitly pushed a commit to
a change that belongs to another project by specifying it as target
ref. This way of adding a new patch set to a change is deprecated as
explained link:user-upload.html#manual_replacement_mapping[here]. It is recommended to only rely on Change-ID's for
link:user-upload.html#push_replace[replacing changes].
