= change ... not found

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit to a change
that cannot be found.

This error message means that the user explicitly pushed a commit to
a non-existing change by specifying it as target ref. This way of
adding a new patch set to a change is deprecated as explained link:user-upload.html#manual_replacement_mapping[here].
It is recommended to only rely on Change-Ids for link:user-upload.html#push_replace[replacing changes].
