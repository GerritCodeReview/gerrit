One or more refs/for/ names blocks change upload
================================================

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit for code
review if the remote git repository has a branch under the
'refs/for/' namespace.

Gerrit uses the 'refs/for/' namespace for magical refs that represent
patch sets that were pushed for code review. If, for a project, a
real branch is created under the 'refs/for/' namespace the namespace
is not magical anymore and Gerrit can't accept further pushes for
code review.

To solve this problem all real branches that exist under the
'refs/for' namespace have to be deleted or renamed in the remote git
repository.

To see which branches exist under the 'refs/for/' namespace a Gerrit
administrator can run the following command:

----
  $ git for-each-ref refs/for
----

If you all these branches should be deleted it can be done with the
following command:

----
  $ for n in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname)' refs/for);
    do git update-ref -d $n; done
----

This problem can occur if users bypass Gerrit and push directly to
the git repository itself (not using the Gerrit server's SSH port).
