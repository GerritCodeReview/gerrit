:linkattrs:
= commit xxxxxxx: Change-Id must be in message footer

With this error message, Gerrit rejects a push of a commit to a project
if the commit message of the pushed commit contains a Change-Id line that
is not in the footer (the last paragraph).

To be picked up by Gerrit, a Change-Id must be in the last paragraph
of a commit message. For details, see link:user-changeid.html[Change-Id Lines].

You can see the commit messages for existing commits in the history
by doing a link:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html[git log,role=external,window=_blank].


== Change-Id is contained in the commit message but not in the last paragraph

If the Change-Id is contained in the commit message but not in its
last paragraph, you have to update the commit message and move the
Change-Id into the last paragraph. How to update the commit message
is explained link:error-push-fails-due-to-commit-message.html[here].

To avoid confusion due to a Change-Id that was meant to be picked up by
Gerrit not being picked up, this is an error whether or not the project
is configured to always require a Change-Id in the commit message.
