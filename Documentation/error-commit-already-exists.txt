commit already exists
=====================

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit to an
existing change via `refs/changes/n` if the commit was already
successfully pushed to the change.  In this case there is no
new commit and consequently there is nothing for Gerrit to do.

For further information about how to resolve this error, please
