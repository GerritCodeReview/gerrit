:linkattrs:
= contains banned commit ...

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit that is
banned or that would merge in an ancestor that is banned.

If a commit was identified as a bad commit (e.g. because it contains
coding that violates intellectual property) and because of this it
was removed from the central git repository it can be marked as
banned. Gerrit will then prevent that this commit ever enters the
repository again by rejecting every push of such a commit with the
error message "contains banned commit ...".

If you have commits that you want to push that are based on a banned
commit you may want to link:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-cherry-pick.html[cherry-pick,role=external,window=_blank] them onto a clean base and push
them again.
