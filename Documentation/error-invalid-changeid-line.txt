invalid Change-Id line format in commit message
===============================================

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit if the commit
message of the pushed commit contains an invalid Change-Id line.

You can see the commit messages for existing commits in the history
by doing a link:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html[git log].

If it was the intention to rework on a change and to push a new patch
set, find the change in the Gerrit WebUI, copy its Change-Id line and
use the copied Change-Id line instead of the invalid Change-Id line
in the commit message of the commit for which the push is failing.
How to do this is explained link:error-push-fails-due-to-commit-message.html#commit_hook[here].

If it was the intention to create a new change in Gerrit simply
remove the invalid Change-Id line from the commit message of the
commit for which the push is failing. How to do this is explained
link:error-push-fails-due-to-commit-message.html#commit_hook[here]. In case you have configured the link:cmd-hook-commit-msg.html[commit hook] a new valid
Change-Id will be automatically generated and inserted.
