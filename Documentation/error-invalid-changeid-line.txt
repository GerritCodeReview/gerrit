:linkattrs:
= invalid Change-Id line format in commit message footer

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit if its commit
message footer contains an invalid Change-Id line.

You can see the commit messages for existing commits in the history
by doing a link:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html[git log,role=external,window=_blank].

If it was the intention to rework a change and to push a new patch
set, find the change in the Gerrit Web UI, copy its Change-Id line and
use it to correct the invalid Change-Id line in the commit message of
the commit for which the push is failing. How to do this is explained
link:error-push-fails-due-to-commit-message.html#commit_hook[here].

If it was the intention to create a new change in Gerrit simply
remove the invalid Change-Id line from the commit message of the
commit for which the push is failing. How to do this is explained
link:error-push-fails-due-to-commit-message.html#commit_hook[here]. In case you have configured the link:cmd-hook-commit-msg.html[commit hook] a new valid
Change-Id will be automatically generated and inserted.
