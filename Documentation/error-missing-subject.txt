:linkattrs:
= commit xxxxxxx: missing subject; Change-Id must be in message footer

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit to a project
which is configured to always require a Change-Id in the commit
message if the commit message of the pushed commit does not contain
a subject and a message, but only a Change-Id.

This error happens if the Change-Id is the only line in the commit
message.

You can see the commit messages for existing commits in the history
by doing a link:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html[git log,role=external,window=_blank].

== Change-Id is the only line in the commit message

Gerrit does not parse the subject of a commit message for the
Change-Id even if this is the only and last paragraph of the commit
message.

If the Change-Id is the only line in the commit message you must update
the commit message and insert a subject as the first line in the commit
message. The Change-Id must be in the last paragraph of the commit
message, i.e. separated from the subject by a blank line. How to update
the commit message is explained
