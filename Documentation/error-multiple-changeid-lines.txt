:linkattrs:
= commit xxxxxxx: multiple Change-Id lines in message footer

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit if the commit
message footer of the pushed commit contains several Change-Id lines.

You can see the commit messages for existing commits in the history
by doing a link:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html[git log,role=external,window=_blank].

If it was the intention to rework a change and to push a new patch
set, find the change in the Gerrit Web UI, copy its Change-Id line and
use the copied Change-Id line instead of the existing Change-Id lines
in the commit message of the commit for which the push is failing.
How to do this is explained link:error-push-fails-due-to-commit-message.html#commit_hook[here].

If it was the intention to create a new change in Gerrit simply
remove all Change-Id lines from the commit message of the
commit for which the push is failing. How to do this is explained
link:error-push-fails-due-to-commit-message.html#commit_hook[here]. In case you have configured the link:cmd-hook-commit-msg.html[commit hook] a new Change-Id
will be automatically generated and inserted.
