multiple Change-Id lines in commit message
==========================================

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit if the commit
message of the pushed commit contains several Change-Id lines.

You can see the commit messages for existing commits in the history
by doing a link:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html[git log].

To solve the problem you have to remove all but one Change-Id line
from those commit messages that contain multiple Change-Id lines.
How to do this is explained link:error-push-fails-due-to-commit-message.html#commit_hook[here].
