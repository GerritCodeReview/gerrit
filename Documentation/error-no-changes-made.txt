With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit as a new
patch set for a change, if the pushed commit is identical to the
current patch set of this change.

A pushed commit is considered to be identical to the current patch
set if

- the files in the commit,
- the commit message,
- the commit date,
- the author of the commit and
- the parents of the commit

are all identical.

In case only the commit date is different, a pushed commit is considered
to be identical to the current patch set if

- the commit has no child commit chained
