not a Gerrit project
====================

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit if the
project to which the push should be done does not exist in the Gerrit
server.

To fix this problem verify
* that the project name in the push command is typed correctly (case
  sensitive) and
* that the project really exists in the Gerrit server to which you
  are trying to push (in the Gerrit WebUI go to 'Admin' -> 'Projects'
  and check that the project is listed).

Details about how to push a commit for code review are explained at
link:user-upload.html#push_create[Create Changes]).
