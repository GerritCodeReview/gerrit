not a Gerrit project
====================

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit if the git
repository to which the push is done does not exist as a project in
the Gerrit server. The name of the project in Gerrit has the same
name as the path of its git repository (excluding '.git' extension).

To fix this problem verify
* that the project name specified as git repository in the push
  command is typed correctly (case sensitive) and
* that the project really exists in the Gerrit server to which you
  are trying to push (in the Gerrit WebUI go to 'Admin' -> 'Projects'
  and check that the project is listed).

Details about how to push a commit for code review are explained at
link:user-upload.html#push_create[Create Changes]).
