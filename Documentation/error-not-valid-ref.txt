not valid ref
=============

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit if the target
ref in the push specification is invalid.

If it was the intention to push a commit for code review the target
ref in the push specification must be the project's magical ref
`refs/for/'branch'` (where 'branch' must be replaced with the name
of the branch to which you want to push your commit). Further details
about how to push a commit for code review are explained at
link:user-upload.html#push_create[Create Changes]).

Example for pushing a commit for code review to the 'master' branch:
----
$ git push ssh://JohnDoe@host:29418/myProject HEAD:refs/for/master
----

If it was the intention to bypass code review and to push directly to
a branch the target ref in the push specification must be the name of
the branch to which you want to push. Further details about how to
bypass code review are explained at link:user-upload.html#bypass_review[Bypass Review].

Example for pushing a commit directly to the 'master' branch (without
code review):
----
$ git push ssh://JohnDoe@host:29418/myProject HEAD:master
