prohibited by Gerrit
====================

This is a general error message that is returned by Gerrit if a push
has been rejected because of failed validation by one or more plugins.

You may want to check the list of plugins installed on Gerrit /plugins
directory: one or more implement the CommitValidationListener
interface and have rejected one of the received commits.
Please refer to the plugin author documentation for knowing the
validation rule applied.
