Prohibited by Gerrit (rejected by plugin X)
===========================================

This is the default error message that is returned by Gerrit if a push
has been rejected because of failed validation by plugin X.

Bear in mind that the (rejected by plugin X) message is always present
and X indicates the plugin name as it appears in /#/admin/plugins/ list.
Please refer to the plugin author documentation for knowing the
validation rule applied.
