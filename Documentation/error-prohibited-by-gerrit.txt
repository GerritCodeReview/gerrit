prohibited by Gerrit
====================

This is a general error message that is returned by Gerrit if a push
is not allowed, e.g. because the pushing user has no sufficient
privileges.

In particular this error occurs:
1. if you push a commit for code review to a branch for which you
   don't have upload permissions (access right '+2 Upload permission'
   in the link:access-control.html#category_READ['Read Access'] category)
2. if you bypass code review without sufficient privileges in the
   link:access-control.html#category_pHD['Push Branch'] category
3. if you push a tag without sufficient privileges in the link:access-control.html#category_pTAG['Push Tag']
   category
