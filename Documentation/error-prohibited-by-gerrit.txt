prohibited by Gerrit
====================

This is a general error message that is returned by Gerrit if a push
is not allowed, e.g. because the pushing user has no sufficient
privileges.

In particular this error occurs:
1. if you push a commit for code review to a branch for which you
   don't have upload permissions (access right '+2 Upload permission'
   in the link:access-control.html#category_READ['Read Access'] category)
2. if you bypass code review without sufficient privileges in the
   link:access-control.html#category_pHD['Push Branch'] category
3. if you push a tag without sufficient privileges in the link:access-control.html#category_pTAG['Push Tag']
   category

For new users it happens often that they accidentally try to bypass
code review. Often their push then fails with the error message
'prohibited by Gerrit' because projects usually do not allow to
bypass code review. The reason that users accidentally try to bypass
code review is normally a wrong destination ref in the push
specification, e.g. 'refs/heads/master' is configured instead of
'refs/for/master'. Details about how to push commits for code review
are explained link:user-upload.html#push_create[here].
