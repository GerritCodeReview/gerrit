= too many commits

This error occurs when a push directly to a branch
link:user-upload.html#bypass_review[bypassing review] contains more commits than
the server is able to validate in a single batch.

The recommended way to avoid this message is to use the
link:user-upload.html#skip_validation[`skip-validation` push option]. Depending
on the number of commits, it may also be feasible to split the push into smaller
batches.

The actual limit is controlled by a
link:config-gerrit.html#receive.maxBatchCommits[server config option].
