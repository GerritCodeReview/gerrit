updates, project creations, indexing of changes, etc.

by link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/refs/heads/master/java/com/google/gerrit/server/events/EventBroker.java[com.google.gerrit.server.events.EventBroker].
It can be implemented by plugins and allows to influence how events are managed.

[[event-hierarchy]]

[[event-listener]]
== Event listener

API for listening to Gerrit events from plugins, without having any

[[stream-events]]
== Stream events

Command that allows a user via CLI or a plugin to receive in a sequential way
some events that are generated in Gerrit. The consumption of the stream by default
is available via SSH connection.
However, plugins can provide an alternative implementation of the event
brokering by sending them over a reliable messaging queueing system (RabbitMQ)
or a pub-sub (Kafka).
