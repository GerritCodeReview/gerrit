[[event]]
== Event

It refers to the link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/refs/heads/master/java/com/google/gerrit/server/events/Event.java[com.google.gerrit.server.events.Event]
base abstract class representing any possible action that is generated or
received in a Gerrit instance. Actions can be associated with change set status
updates, project creations, indexing of changes, etc.

[[event-broker]]
== Event broker

Distributes Gerrit Events to listeners if they are allowed to see them.

[[event-dispatcher]]
== Event dispatcher

Interface for posting events to the Gerrit event system. Implemented by default
by link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/refs/heads/master/java/com/google/gerrit/server/events/EventBroker.java[com.google.gerrit.server.events.EventBroker].
It can be implemented by plugins and allows to influence how events are managed.

[[event-hierarchy]]
== Event hierarchy

Hierarchy of events representing anything that can happen in Gerrit.

[[event-listener]]
== Event listener

API for listening to Gerrit events from plugins, without having any
visibility restrictions.

[[multi-primary]]
== Multi-primary
Multi-primary typically refers to configurations where multiple Gerrit primary
processes are running in a cluster together.

=== Multi-primary with shared storage
A variation of multi-primary that shares a file storage volume for the git
repositories. These configurations can use the
link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability[high-availability plugin]
to synchronize or share caches, indexes, events, and web sessions.

[[multi-site-primaries]]
== Multi-site primaries
Multi-site primaries typically refers to configurations where multiple Gerrit
primary processes are running in different (likely geographically distributed)
clusters (sites). This also typically makes use of a multi-primary configuration
within each cluster. Synchronization across sites is necessary to detect and
prevent split-brain scenarios. These configurations can use the
link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/multi-site[multi-site plugin]
to facilitate synchronization.

[[primary]]
== Gerrit Primary
A Gerrit primary is the link:pgm-daemon.html[main Gerrit process]. Most
installations of Gerrit have only a single Gerrit primary running at a time for
their service.

[[replica]]
== Gerrit Replica
A Gerrit process running with the link:pgm-daemon.html[--replica switch]
provided. This permits only read operations by clients. Replicas can be run in
the same cluster as a primary or in other clusters/sites (likely facilitated
by the link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/replication[replication plugin]).

[[stream-events]]
== Stream events

Command that allows a user via CLI or a plugin to receive in a sequential way
some events that are generated in Gerrit. The consumption of the stream by default
is available via SSH connection.
However, plugins can provide an alternative implementation of the event
brokering by sending them over a reliable messaging queueing system (RabbitMQ)
or a pub-sub (Kafka).
