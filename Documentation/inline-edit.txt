= Inline Edit

Changes can be created and amended directly in broswer. This is a guide
through the inline edit feature that explains the complete and partial
browser based workflow.

[[create-change]]
== Creating Empty Changes

When a chane was already uploaded to Gerrit it can be amended, later more on
this. New change can be created directly in browser, no need to clone the
whole repository to make trivial changes. There two different ways how empty
changes can be created: in project info screen by clicking on "Create Change"
button and in change screen by clicking on "Follow-Up" button. In former case
an empty change is created in specified project and in later case an empty
change is created as follow-up change of selected change.

[[amending-change]]
== Amending Changes

To create a change edit commit message or file must be changed. Once
change edit is created it can be deleted, published or rebased. The normal
workflow is create a change edit by changing commit message or a file content
and publish it. Publishing change edit promotes it to normal revision. Once
change edit is published, the Git ref that represents change edit is deleted.

Files can be added, removed, restored and modified in context of change
edit. The main navigation interface for manipulating existing and adding
restoring and deleting files in change edit is file table. It was extended for
inline edit feature to support additional mode: Edit Mode. To switch between
"Edit Mode" and "Review Mode" new "Edit" button is exposed on file table
header. In "Edit Mode" restore and delete icons are added in frint of files
and hyperlinks navigates to Edit Screen instead of Side By Side screen.

[[create-change-edit-by-editing-commit-message]]

By clicking on "Edit Message" button in change screen header, new change edit
is created.

When change edit created, the file table preserves "Edit Mode" to seamlessly
allow further change edit manipulations or change edit publishing.

[[create-change-edit-by-amending-file-content-from-side-by-side-screen]]

Change edit can be created by clicking on edit icon in side by side screen. In
this case the file that was reviewed is opened in edit screen and can be
directly manipulated. Clicking on "Save" button creates change edit and returns
to chang screen. Clickin on "Cancel" button aborts the editin and the user is
taken to change screen as well.

[[create-change-edit-by-amending-file-content-from-file-table]]

When file table is switched in "Edit Mode" change edit can be created by
clicking on icons in front of files or by clicking on files or commit message
hyperlink and changing the content in edit screen.


[[create-change-edit-by-adding-file-to-change]]


When file table is switched to "Edit Mode" additional "Add..." button is hown
is added to the header of  file tavble. Clicking on this nutton opens popup
and allows to enter the file name. Clicking on 'tab' in file name input field,
retrieve the content of the file and put it into the textarea in poppup dialog.
When new file is added, the text area remains empty. Clicking auf "Save" button
in the poopup dialog adds new or existing file to the change.

[[reviewing-changes-made-in-change-edit]]

To compare changes made in changed edit compared to base patch set, side by side
screen is used (as usually). For that file table is switched to "Review Mode".
Once the mode is changed, hyperlinks navigates to side by side screen. On side
by side screen the change edit patch set is presented as "edit", following
directly after its base patch set. Note that patch set may exist that were
created after the changed edit was created. For example this sequence:


`1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 edit 10`


means that the change edit was created on top of patch set number 9 and regular
patch set was uploaded later.
