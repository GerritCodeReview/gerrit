Changes can be created and amended directly in broswer. This is a guide
through the inline edit feature that explains the complete and partial
browser based workflow.

== Creating Empty Changes

When a chane was already uploaded to Gerrit it can be amended, later more on
this. New change can be created directly in browser, no need to clone the
whole repository to make trivial changes. There two different ways how empty
changes can be created: in project info screen by clicking on "Create Change"
button and in change screen by clicking on "Follow-Up" button. In former case
an empty change is created in specified project and in later case an empty
change is created as follow-up change of selected change.
