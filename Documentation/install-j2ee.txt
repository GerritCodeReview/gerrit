Gerrit Code Review - J2EE Installation
======================================

Gerrit binary distributions include a standalone Jetty container, but
are packaged as a standard WAR file to permit easy deployment to other
existing container installations if a standalone daemon is not
preferred by the administartor.

Gerrit Code Review can be installed into any J2EE servlet container,
including popular open source containers such as Jetty or Tomcat, or
any commerical server which supports the J2EE servlet specification.

Complete the link:install.html#database_setup[database setup] and
link:install.html#init_site_path[site initialization] tasks described
in the standard installation documentation.

Deploy the 'gerrit.war' file to your application server.

Configure the JNDI DataSource 'jdbc/ReviewDb' for the gerrit web
application context to point to the database you created above.  Don't
forget to ensure your JNDI configuration can load the necessary JDBC
drivers.  You may wish to ensure connection pooling is configured and
enabled within the DataSource.

('Optional') Add Bouncy Castle Crypto API to the web application's
classpath.  Usually its best to load this library from the servlet
container's extensions directory, but gerrit.war could also be
manually repackaged to include it within 'WEB-INF/lib/'.
