= Gerrit Code Review - Quick get started guide

****
This guide was made with the impatient in mind, ready to try out Gerrit on their
own server but not prepared to make the full installation procedure yet.

Explanation is sparse and you should not use a server installed this way in a
live setup, this is made with proof of concept activities in mind.

It is presumed you install it on a Unix based server such as any of the Linux
flavors or BSD.

It's also presumed that you have access to an OpenID enabled email address.
Examples of OpenID enable email providers are Gmail, Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail.
It's also possible to register a custom email address with OpenID, but that is
outside the scope of this quick installation guide. For testing purposes one of
the above providers should be fine. Please note that network access to the
OpenID provider you choose is necessary for both you and your Gerrit instance.

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

Most distributions come with Java today. Do you already have Java installed?

----
  $ java -version
  openjdk version "1.8.0_72"
  OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_72-b15)
  OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.72-b15, mixed mode)
----

If Java isn't installed, get it:

* JRE, minimum version 1.8 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Download]


[[user]]
== Create a user to host the Gerrit service

We will run the service as a non-privileged user on your system.
First create the user and then become the user:

----
  $ sudo adduser gerrit
  $ sudo su gerrit
----

If you don't have root privileges you could skip this step and run Gerrit
as your own user as well.


[[download]]
== Download Gerrit

It's time to download the archive that contains the Gerrit web and ssh service.

You can choose from different versions to download from here:

* https://www.gerritcodereview.com/download/index.html[A list of releases available]

This tutorial is based on version 2.2.2, and you can download that from this link

* https://www.gerritcodereview.com/download/gerrit-2.2.2.war[Link to the 2.2.2 war archive]


[[initialization]]
== Initialize the Site

It's time to run the initialization, and with the batch switch enabled, we don't have to answer any questions at all:

----
  gerrit@host:~$ java -jar gerrit.war init --batch -d ~/gerrit_testsite
  Generating SSH host key ... rsa(simple)... done
  Initialized /home/gerrit/gerrit_testsite
  Executing /home/gerrit/gerrit_testsite/bin/gerrit.sh start
  Starting Gerrit Code Review: OK
  gerrit@host:~$
----

When the init is complete, you can review your settings in the
file `'$site_path/etc/gerrit.config'`.

Note that initialization also starts the server.  If any settings changes are
made, the server must be restarted before they will take effect.

----
  gerrit@host:~$ ~/gerrit_testsite/bin/gerrit.sh restart
  Stopping Gerrit Code Review: OK
  Starting Gerrit Code Review: OK
  gerrit@host:~$
----

The server can be also stopped and started by passing the `stop` and `start`
commands to gerrit.sh.

----
  gerrit@host:~$ ~/gerrit_testsite/bin/gerrit.sh stop
  Stopping Gerrit Code Review: OK
  gerrit@host:~$
  gerrit@host:~$ ~/gerrit_testsite/bin/gerrit.sh start
  Starting Gerrit Code Review: OK
  gerrit@host:~$
----

== Project creation

Your base Gerrit server is now running and you have a user that's ready
to interact with it.  You now have two options, either you create a new
test project to work with or you already have a git with history that
you would like to import into Gerrit and try out code review on.

=== New project from scratch
If you choose to create a new repository from scratch, it's easier for
you to create a project with an initial commit in it. That way first
time setup between client and server is easier.

This is done via the SSH port:

----
  user@host:~$ ssh -p 29418 user@localhost gerrit create-project demo-project --empty-commit
  user@host:~$
----

This will create a repository that you can clone to work with.

=== Already existing project

The other alternative is if you already have a git project that you
want to try out Gerrit on.
First you have to create the project.  This is done via the SSH port:

----
  user@host:~$ ssh -p 29418 user@localhost gerrit create-project demo-project
  user@host:~$
----

You need to make sure that at least initially your account is granted
"Create Reference" privileges for the refs/heads/* reference.
This is done via the web interface in the Admin/Projects/Access page
that correspond to your project.

After that it's time to upload the previous history to the server:

----
  user@host:~/my-project$ git push ssh://user@localhost:29418/demo-project *:*
  Counting objects: 2011, done.
  Writing objects: 100% (2011/2011), 456293 bytes, done.
  Total 2011 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
  To ssh://user@localhost:29418/demo-project
   * [new branch]      master -> master
  user@host:~/my-project$
----

This will create a repository that you can clone to work with.


== My first change

Download a local clone of the repository and move into it

----
  user@host:~$ git clone ssh://user@localhost:29418/demo-project
  Cloning into demo-project...
  remote: Counting objects: 2, done
  remote: Finding sources: 100% (2/2)
  remote: Total 2 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
  user@host:~$ cd demo-project
  user@host:~/demo-project$
----

Then make a change to it and upload it as a reviewable change in Gerrit.

----
  user@host:~/demo-project$ date > testfile.txt
  user@host:~/demo-project$ git add testfile.txt
  user@host:~/demo-project$ git commit -m "My pretty test commit"
  [master ff643a5] My pretty test commit
   1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
   create mode 100644 testfile.txt
  user@host:~/demo-project$
----

Usually when you push to a remote git, you push to the reference
`'/refs/heads/branch'`, but when working with Gerrit you have to push to a
virtual branch representing "code review before submission to branch".
This virtual name space is known as /refs/for/<branch>

----
  user@host:~/demo-project$ git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
  Counting objects: 4, done.
  Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 293 bytes, done.
  Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
  remote:
  remote: New Changes:
  remote:   http://localhost:8080/1
  remote:
  To ssh://user@localhost:29418/demo-project
   * [new branch]      HEAD -> refs/for/master
  user@host:~/demo-project$
----

You should now be able to access your change by browsing to the http URL
suggested above, http://localhost:8080/1


== Quick Installation Complete

This covers the scope of getting Gerrit started and your first change uploaded.
It doesn't give any clue as to how the review workflow works, please read

learn more about the workflow of Gerrit.

installation page].
