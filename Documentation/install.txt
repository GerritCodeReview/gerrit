Gerrit Code Review - Standalone Daemon Installation Guide
=========================================================

[[requirements]]
Requirements
------------
To run the Gerrit service, the following requirements must be met on
the host:

* JDK, minimum version 1.6 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Download]

You'll also need a SQL database to house the review metadata. You have the
choice of either using the embedded H2 or to host your own MySQL or PostgreSQL.


[[download]]
Download Gerrit
---------------

Current and past binary releases of Gerrit can be obtained from
the downloads page at the project site:

* http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/downloads/list[Gerrit Downloads]

Download any current `*.war` package. The war will be referred to as
`gerrit.war` from this point forward, so you may find it easier to
rename the downloaded file.

If you would prefer to build Gerrit directly from source, review
the notes under link:dev-readme.html[developer setup].

[[init]]
Initialize the Site
-------------------

Gerrit stores configuration files, the server's SSH keys, and the
managed Git repositories under a local directory, typically referred
to as `'$site_path'`.  If the embedded H2 database is being used,
its data files will also be stored under this directory.

You also have to decide where to store your server side git repositories. This
can either be a relative path under `'$site_path'` or an absolute path
anywhere on your server system. You have to choose a place before commencing
your init phase.

Initialize a new site directory by running the init command, passing
the path of the site directory to be created as an argument to the
'-d' option.  Its recommended that Gerrit Code Review be given its
own user account on the host system:

----
  sudo adduser gerrit2
  sudo su gerrit2

  java -jar gerrit.war init -d /path/to/your/gerrit_application_directory
----

'Please note:' If you choose a location where your new user doesn't
have any privileges, you may have to manually create the directory first and
then give ownership of that location to the `'gerrit2'` user.

If run from an interactive terminal, the init command will prompt through a
series of configuration questions, including gathering information
about the database created above.  If the terminal is not interactive,
running the init command will choose some reasonable default selections,
and will use the embedded H2 database. Once the init phase is complete,
you can review your settings in the file `'$site_path/etc/gerrit.config'`.

When running the init command, additional JARs might be downloaded to
support optional selected functionality.  If a download fails a URL will
be displayed and init will wait for the user to manually download the JAR
and store it in the target location.

When the init phase is complete, the daemon will be automatically started
in the background and your web browser will open to the site:

----
  Initialized /home/gerrit2/review_site
  Executing /home/gerrit2/review_site/bin/gerrit.sh start
  Starting Gerrit Code Review: OK
  Waiting for server to start ... OK
  Opening browser ...
----

When the browser opens, sign in to Gerrit through the web interface.
The first user to sign-in and register an account will be
automatically placed into the fully privileged Administrators group,
permitting server management over the web and over SSH.  Subsequent
users will be automatically registered as unprivileged users.


Installation Complete
---------------------

Your base Gerrit server is now installed and running.  You're now ready to
either set up more projects or start working with the projects you've already
imported.


[[project_setup]]
Project Setup
-------------

See link:project-setup.html[Project Setup] for further details on
how to register a new project with Gerrit.  This step is necessary
if existing Git repositories were not imported during 'init'.


[[rc_d]]
Start/Stop Daemon
-----------------

To control the Gerrit Code Review daemon that is running in the
background, use the rc.d style start script created by 'init':

====
  review_site/bin/gerrit.sh start
  review_site/bin/gerrit.sh stop
  review_site/bin/gerrit.sh restart
====

('Optional') Link the gerrit.sh script into rc3.d so the daemon
automatically starts and stops with the operating system:

====
  sudo ln -snf `pwd`/review_site/bin/gerrit.sh /etc/init.d/gerrit
  sudo ln -snf /etc/init.d/gerrit /etc/rc3.d/S90gerrit
====

To install Gerrit into an existing servlet container instead of using
the embedded Jetty server, see
link:install-j2ee.html[J2EE installation].


[[customize]]
Site Customization
------------------

Gerrit Code Review supports some site-specific customization options.
For more information, see the related topics in this manual:

* link:config-reverseproxy.html[Reverse Proxy]
* link:config-sso.html[Single Sign-On Systems]
* link:config-themes.html[Themes]
* link:config-gitweb.html[Gitweb Integration]
* link:config-gerrit.html[Other System Settings]


[[anonymous_access]]
Anonymous Access
----------------

Exporting the Git repository directory
(link:config-gerrit.html#gerrit.basePath[gerrit.basePath]) over the
anonymous, unencrypted git:// protocol is more efficient than
Gerrit's internal SSH daemon.  See the `git-daemon` documentation
for details on how to configure this if anonymous access is desired.

[[plugins]]
Plugins
-------

Place Gerrit plugins in the review_site/plugins directory to have them loaded on Gerrit startup.
