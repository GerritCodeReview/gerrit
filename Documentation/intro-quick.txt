= Gerrit Product Overview

Gerrit is a web-based code review tool built on top of the
https://git-scm.com/[Git version control system]. This introduction provides
an overview of Gerrit and describes how Gerrit integrates into a typical
development workflow. It also provides a brief tutorial that shows how to manage
a change using Gerrit.

== What is Gerrit?

Gerrit makes code review easy by providing a lightweight framework for reviewing
commits before they are accepted by the codebase. Gerrit works equally well for
projects where approving changes is restricted to selected users, as is typical
for Open Source software development, as well as projects where all contributors
are trusted.
