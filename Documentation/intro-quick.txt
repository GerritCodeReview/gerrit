= Gerrit Code Review Product Overview

Gerrit Code Review is a web-based code review tool built on
https://git-scm.com/[Git version control].

== What is Gerrit?

Gerrit makes code review possible. Gerrit provides a framework you and your
teams can use to review commits before they're accepted into a code base. Gerrit
works equally well implemented in open source projects that limit the number of
users who can approve changes (typical in open source software development) and
in projects in which all contributors are trusted.

== What is Code Review?

Code reviews identify mistakes before customers find them. In a world of
continuous integration, it's essential that code be robust before it's released.
When code is reviewed, developers:

. Work carefully and consistently
. Learn best practices and new techniques from other developers
. Implement consistency and quality across the code base

Code reviews typically turn up issues related to:

. Design: Is code well-designed and suited to the code base?
. Functionality: Does code perform as intended and in a way that is good for users?
. Complexity: Can other developers understand and use the code?
. Naming: Does the code contain clear names for elements such as variables, classes, and methods?
. Comments: Are comments specific and complete?
