## SYNOPSIS

> 
> 
>     ssh -p <port> <host> gerrit stream-events

## DESCRIPTION

Provides a portal into the major events occurring on the server,
outputting activity data in real-time to the client. Events are filtered
by the callerâ€™s access permissions, ensuring the caller only receives
events for changes they can view on the web, or in the project
repository.

Event output is in JSON, one event per line.

## ACCESS

Caller must be a member of the privileged *Administrators* group, or
have been granted [the *Stream Events* global
capability](access-control.html#capability_streamEvents).

## SCRIPTING

This command is intended to be used in scripts.

## OPTIONS

  - \--subscribe|-s  
    Type of the event to subscribe to. Multiple --subscribe options may
    be specified to subscribe to multiple events. When this option is
    provided, only subscribed events are emitted and all other events
    are ignored. When this option is omitted, all events are emitted.

## EXAMPLES

``` 
  $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit stream-events
  {"type":"comment-added",change:{"project":"tools/gerrit", ...}, ...}
  {"type":"comment-added",change:{"project":"tools/gerrit", ...}, ...}
```

Only subscribe to specific event types:

``` 
  $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit stream-events \
      -s patchset-created -s ref-replicated
```

## SCHEMA

The JSON messages consist of nested objects referencing the **change**,
**patchSet**, **account** involved, and other attributes as appropriate.

Note that any field may be missing in the JSON messages, so consumers of
this JSON stream should deal with that appropriately.
