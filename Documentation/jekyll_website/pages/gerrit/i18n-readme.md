Aside from actually writing translations, there are some issues with the
way the code produces output. Most of the UI should support
right-to-left (RTL) languages.

## Labels

Labels and their values are defined in project.config by the Gerrit
administrator or project owners. Only a single translation of these
strings is supported.

## /Gerrit Gerrit.html

  - The title of the host page is not translated.

  - The \<noscript\> tag is not translated.

## GERRIT
