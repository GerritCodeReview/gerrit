= Quickstart for Installing Gerrit on Linux

This quickstart explains how to install Gerrit on a Linux machine.

[NOTE]
====
The steps provided below are for demonstration purposes only. They are not intended for use in a production environment.

To install a Gerrit production environment, see
link:install.html[Standalone Daemon Installation Guide].
====

== Before you begin

Be sure you have:

. A Unix-based server, including any Linux flavor or Berkeley Sofware
    Distribution (BSD).
. Java SE Runtime Environment 1.8 (or higher).

== Download Gerrit

From the Linux machine on which you want to install Gerrit:

. Open a terminal window.
. Download the Gerrit archive.

To view all previous archices, see link:https://gerrit-releases.storage.googleapis.com/index.html[Gerrit Code Review: Releases].

The following steps use Gerrrit 2.15.1:

....
wget https://www.gerritcodereview.com/download/gerrit-2.15.1.war
....

NOTE: To build and install Gerrit from the source files, see
link:dev-readme.html[Gerrit Code Review: Developer Setup].

== Install and initialize Gerrit

From the command line, enter:

....
java -jar gerrit*.war init --batch --dev -d ~/gerrit_testsite
....

This command takes two parameters:

* `--batch` assigns default values to several Gerrit configuration
    options. To learn more about these options, see
    link:config-gerrit.html[Configuration].
* `--dev` configures the Gerrit server to use the authentication
  option, `DEVELOPMENT_BECOME_ANY_ACCOUNT`, which enables you to
  witch between different users to explore how Gerrit works. To learn more about setting up Gerrit for development, see
  link:dev-readme.html[Gerrit Code Review: Developer Setup].

While this command executes, status messages are displayed in the terminal window. For example:

....
Generating SSH host key ... rsa(simple)... done
Initialized /home/gerrit/gerrit_testsite
Executing /home/gerrit/gerrit_testsite/bin/gerrit.sh start
Starting Gerrit Code Review: OK
....

The last message confirms that the Gerrit service is running:

`Starting Gerrit Code Review: OK`. 

== Update the listen URL

To prevent outside connections from contacting your new Gerrit instance (strongly recommended), change the URL on which Gerrit listens from `*` to `localhost`. For example:

....
git config --file ~/gerrit_testsite/etc/gerrit.config httpd.listenUrl 'http://localhost:8080'
....

== Restart the Gerrit service

To implement the new authentication type and listen URL changes, restart the Gerrit service:

....
~/gerrit_testsite/bin/gerrit.sh restart
....

== Viewing Gerrit

To view your new basic installation of Gerrit, go to:

....
http://localhost:8080
....

== Next steps

Now that you have a simple version of Gerrit running on your Linux machine, use the installation to explore the user interface and learn about Gerrit. For more detailed installation instructions, see link:[Standalone Daemon Installation Guide](install.html).
