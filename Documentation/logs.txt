= Gerrit Code Review - Logs

Gerrit writes log files in the `$site/logs/` folder tracking requests,
background and plugin activity and errors. By default logs are written
in text format, optionally in json format. By default log files are compressed
at server startup and then daily at 11pm and rotated every midnight.

== Logs

The following logs are written.

=== HTTPD Log

The httpd log tracks HTTP requests processed by Gerrit's http daemon
and is written to `$site/logs/httpd_log`.

Format is an enhanced NCSA combined log [1], if a log field is not present,
a "-" is substituted:

* `host`: The IP address or host/subdomain name of the HTTP client that
  made the HTTP resource request.
* `[thread name]`: name of the Java thread executing the request. 
* `remote logname`:  the identifier used to identify the client making the
  HTTP request [2], Gerrit always logs a dash `-`.
* `username`: the username, or user ID used by the client for authentication.
* `[date:time]`: The date and time stamp of the HTTP request.
  The time that the request was received. The format is:
  ** `[day/month/year:hour:minute:second zone]`
  ** `day = 2*digit`
  ** `month = 3*letter`
  ** `year = 4*digit`
  ** `hour = 2*digit`
  ** `minute = 2*digit`
  ** `second = 2*digit`
  ** `zone = ('+' | '-') 4*digit`
* `request`: The request line from the client is given in double quotes.
  ** the HTTP method used by the client
  ** the resource the client requested
  ** the protocol used by the client
* `statuscode`: the HTTP status code [3] that the server sent back to the client.
* `response size`: the number of bytes of data transferred as part of the HTTP
  request, not including the HTTP header.
* `latency`: response time in milliseconds
* `referer`: the `Referer` HTTP request header. This gives the site that
  the client reports having been referred from.
* `client agent`: the client agent which sent the request.

  ** `minute = 2*digit`
  ** `second = 2*digit`

* `time searching for reuse`: time jgit searched for deltas which can be reused.
* `time searching for sizes`: time jgit was searching for sizes.
* `time counting`: time jgit was counting objects.

  -1 means no bitmap index available.
