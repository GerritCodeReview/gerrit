= Gerrit Code Review - JavaScript Plugin Checks API

This API is provided by link:pg-plugin-dev.html#plugin-checks[plugin.checks()].
It allows plugins to contribute to the "Checks" tab and summary:

Each plugin can link:#register[register] a checks provider that will be called
when a change page is loaded. Such a call would return a list of `Runs` and each
run can contain a list of `Results`.

`Reults` messages will render as markdown. It follows the CommonMark spec except
inline images and direct HTML are not rendered and kept as plaintext.

The details of the ChecksApi are documented in the
link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/master/polygerrit-ui/app/api/checks.ts[source code].
Note that this link points to the `master` branch and might thus reflect a
newer version of the API than your Gerrit installation.

If no plugins are registered with the ChecksApi, then the Checks tab will be
hidden.

You can read about the motivation, the use cases and the original plans in the
link:https://www.gerritcodereview.com/design-docs/ci-reboot.html[design doc].
