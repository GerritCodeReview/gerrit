= Gerrit Code Review - PolyGerrit Plugin Styling

Plugins should be html-based and imported following PolyGerrit's
link:pg-plugin-dev.html#loading[dev guide].

Sample code for testing endpoints:

``` js
Gerrit.install(plugin => {
  // Change endpoint below
  const endpoint = 'change-metadata-item';
  plugin.hook(endpoint).onAttached(element => {
    console.log(endpoint, element);
    const el = element.appendChild(document.createElement('div'));
    el.textContent = 'Ah, there it is. Lovely.';
    el.style = 'background: pink; line-height: 4em; text-align: center;';
  });
});
```

== Default parameters
All endpoints receive the following parameters, set as attributes to custom
components that are instantiated at the endpoint:

* `plugin`
+
the current plugin instance, the one that is used by `Gerrit.install()`.

* `content`
+
decorated DOM Element, is only set for registrations that decorate existing
components.

== Plugin endpoints

The following endpoints are available to plugins.

=== change-view-integration
This extension point is located between `Files` and `Messages` section on the
change view page, and it may take full page's width. Primary purpose is to
enable plugins to display custom CI-related information (build status, etc).

* `change`
+
current change displayed, an instance of
link:rest-api-changes.html#change-info[ChangeInfo]

* `revision`
+
current revision displayed, an instance of
link:rest-api-changes.html#revision-info[RevisionInfo]

=== change-metadata-item
The change-metadata-item extension point is located on the bottom of the change
view left panel, under the `Label Status` and `Links` sections. Its width is
equal to the left panel's, and its primary purpose is to allow plugins to add
sections of metadata to the left panel.

In addition to default parameters, the following are available:

* `change`
+
current change displayed, an instance of
link:rest-api-changes.html#change-info[ChangeInfo]

* `revision`
+
