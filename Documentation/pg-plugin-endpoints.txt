= Gerrit Code Review - JavaScript Plugin Endpoints

This document describes Gerrit JavaScript plugin endpoints that you can hook
into for customizing the UI. It is assumed that you are familiar with
link:pg-plugin-dev.html#loading[the general dev guide].

You can either hook into an endpoint by calling `plugin.hook(endpoint)` and
then interact with the returned `HookApi`, which has `onAttached(callback)` and
`onDetached(callback)` methods.

Or you can define a
link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements[Web Component,role=external,window=_blank]
and register it directly using
`plugin.registerCustomComponent(endpoint, elementName)`.

Sample code for using an endpoint:

``` js
Gerrit.install(plugin => {
  const endpoint = 'change-metadata-item';
  plugin.hook(endpoint).onAttached(element => {
    const el = element.appendChild(document.createElement('div'));
    el.textContent = 'Ah, there it is. Lovely.';
    el.style = 'background: pink; line-height: 4em; text-align: center;';
  });
});
```
