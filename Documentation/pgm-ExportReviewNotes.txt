SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'java' -jar gerrit.war 'ExportReviewNotes' -d <SITE_PATH>

DESCRIPTION

Scans every submitted change and creates an initial notes

concurrently to the server if the database is MySQL or PostgreSQL.
If the database is H2, this task must be run by itself.

\--site-path::
	Location of the gerrit.config file, and all other per-site
	configuration data, supporting libraries and log files.

\--threads::
	Number of threads to perform the scan work with.  Default: 2.

CONTEXT
-------
This command can only be run on a server which has direct
connectivity to the metadata database, and local access to the
managed Git repositories.

EXAMPLES
--------
To generate all review information:

====
