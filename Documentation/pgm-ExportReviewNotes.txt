--------
[verse]
'java' -jar gerrit.war 'ExportReviewNotes' -d <SITE_PATH>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Scans every submitted change and creates an initial notes
branch detailing the previous submission information for
each merged changed.

This task can take quite some time, but can run in the background
concurrently to the server if the database is MySQL or PostgreSQL.
If the database is H2, this task must be run by itself.

\--site-path::
	Location of the gerrit.config file, and all other per-site
	configuration data, supporting libaries and log files.

\--threads::
	Number of threads to perform the scan work with.  Defaults to
	twice the number of CPUs available.

CONTEXT
-------
This command can only be run on a server which has direct
connectivity to the metadata database, and local access to the
managed Git repositories.

EXAMPLES
--------
To generate all review information:

====
	$ java -jar gerrit.war ExportReviewNotes -d site_path --threads 16
