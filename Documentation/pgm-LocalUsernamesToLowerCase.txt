= LocalUsernamesToLowerCase

== NAME
LocalUsernamesToLowerCase - Convert the local username of every
account to lower case

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
--
_java_ -jar gerrit.war _LocalUsernamesToLowerCase_
  -d <SITE_PATH>
--

== DESCRIPTION
Converts the local username for every account to lower case. The
local username is the username that is used to login into the Gerrit
Web UI. The local username is stored a external ID with scheme
`gerrit`.

[IMPORTANT]
This program does not modify usernames in the `username` scheme.

This task is only intended to be run if the configuration parameter
link:config-gerrit.html#ldap.localUsernameToLowerCase[ldap.localUsernameToLowerCase]
was set to true to achieve case insensitive LDAP login to the Gerrit
Web UI.

Please be aware that the conversion of the local usernames to lower
case can't be undone.

The program will produce errors if there are accounts that have the
same local username, but with different case. In this case the local
username for these accounts is not converted to lower case.

After all usernames have been migrated, the link:pgm-reindex.html[
reindex] program is automatically invoked to reindex all accounts.

This task cannot run in the background concurrently to the server;
it must be run by itself.

== OPTIONS

-d::
--site-path::
	Location of the gerrit.config file, and all other per-site
	configuration data, supporting libraries and log files.

== CONTEXT
This command can only be run on a server which has direct
connectivity to the managed Git repositories.

== EXAMPLES
To convert the local username of every account to lower case:

----
	$ java -jar gerrit.war LocalUsernamesToLowerCase -d site_path
