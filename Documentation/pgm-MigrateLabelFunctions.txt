== NAME
MigrateLabelFunctions - Migrates label functions to submit requirements

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
--
_java_ -jar gerrit.war MigrateLabelFunctions_
  -d <SITE_PATH>
--

== DESCRIPTION
Migrates label functions to submit requirements and resetting the label
functions to `NO_BLOCK`.

NOTE: If a project has Prolog based submit rules, its label functions will not
be migrated because the newly created submit requirements might not behave as
intended.

For labels that were skipped, i.e. had only one "zero" predefined value, the
migrator creates a non-applicable submit-requirement for them. This is done so
that if a parent project had a submit-requirement with the same name, then it's
not inherited by this project.

If there is an existing label and there exists a "submit requirement" with the
same name, the migrator checks if the submit-requirement to be created matches
the one in project.config. If they don't match, a warning message is printed,
otherwise nothing happens. In either cases, the existing submit-requirement is
not altered.
