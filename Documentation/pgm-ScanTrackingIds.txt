ScanTrackingIds
===============

NAME
----
ScanTrackingIds - Rescan changes to index trackingids

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'java' -jar gerrit.war 'ScanTrackingIds' -d <SITE_PATH>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Scans every known change and updates the indexed tracking
ids associated with the change, after editing the trackingid
configuration in gerrit.config.

This task can take quite some time, but can run in the background
concurrently to the server if the database is MySQL or PostgreSQL.
If the database is H2, this task must be run by itself.

OPTIONS
-------

-d::
\--site-path::
	Location of the gerrit.config file, and all other per-site
	configuration data, supporting libraries and log files.

\--threads::
	Number of threads to perform the scan work with.  Defaults to
	twice the number of CPUs available.

CONTEXT
-------
This command can only be run on a server which has direct
connectivity to the metadata database, and local access to the
managed Git repositories.

EXAMPLES
--------
To rescan all known trackingids:

====
	$ java -jar gerrit.war ScanTrackingIds -d site_path --threads 16
