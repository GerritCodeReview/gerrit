NAME
----
daemon - Gerrit network server

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'java' -DGerritServer=PATH -jar gerrit.war 'daemon'
	[\--enable-httpd | \--disable-httpd]
	[\--enable-sshd | \--disable-sshd]
	[\--slave]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Runs the Gerrit network daemon on the local system, configured as
per the local copy of link:config-gerrit.html[gerrit.config].

The path to gerrit.config is read from the metadata database,
which requires that all slaves (and master) reading from the same
database must place gerrit.config at the same location on the local
filesystem.  However, any option within gerrit.config, including
link:config-gerrit.html#gerrit.basePath[gerrit.basePath] may be set
to different values.

OPTIONS
-------

-DGerritServer=PATH::
	Path of the GerritServer.properties file, which describes
	how to connect to the database.  To obtain a template of this
	file get it from the WAR:
+
====
java -jar gerrit.war \--cat extra/GerritServer.properties_example >GerritServer.properties
====

\--enable-httpd::
\--disable-httpd::
	Enable (or disable) the internal HTTP daemon, answering
	web requests.  Enabled by default.

\--enable-sshd::
\--disable-sshd::
	Enable (or disable) the internal SSH daemon, answering SSH
	clients and remotely executed commands.  Enabled by default.

\--slave::
	Run in slave mode, permitting only read operations
    by clients.  Commands which modify state such as
    link:cmd-receive-pack.html[recieve-pack] (creates new changes
    or updates existing ones) or link:cmd-approve.html[approve]
    (sets approve marks) are disabled.
+
This option automatically implies '\--disable-httpd \--enable-sshd'.

CONTEXT
-------
This command can only be run on a server which has direct
connectivity to the metadata database, and local access to the
managed Git repositories.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Slave daemon caches can quickly become out of date when modifications
are made on the master.  The following configuration is suggested in
a slave to reduce the maxAge for each cache entry, so that changes
are recognized in a reasonable period of time:

----
[cache "accounts"]
  maxAge = 5 min
[cache "accounts_byemail"]
  maxAge = 5 min
[cache "diff"]
  maxAge = 5 min
[cache "groups"]
  maxAge = 5 min
[cache "projects"]
  maxAge = 5 min
[cache "sshkeys"]
  maxAge = 5 min
----

and if LDAP support was enabled, also include:
----
[cache "ldap_groups"]
  maxAge = 5 min
[cache "ldap_usernames"]
  maxAge = 5 min
----

Automatic cache coherency between master and slave systems is
planned to be implemented in a future version.
