NAME

init - Initialize a new Gerrit server installation

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'java' -jar gerrit.war 'init'
	-d <SITE_PATH>
	[\--batch]
	[\--no-auto-start]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a new Gerrit server installation, interactively prompting
for some basic setup prior to writing default configuration files
into a newly created `$site_path`.

If run an an existing `$site_path`, init will upgrade some resources
as necessary.

OPTIONS
-------
\--batch::
	Run in batch mode, skipping interactive prompts.  Reasonable
	configuration defaults are chosen based on the whims of
	the Gerrit developers.

\--no-auto-start::
	Don't automatically start the daemon after initializing a
	newly created site path.  This permits the administartor
	to inspect and modify the configuration before the daemon
	is started.

-d::
\--site-path::
	Location of the gerrit.config file, and all other per-site
	configuration data, supporting libaries and log files.

CONTEXT
-------
This command can only be run on a server which has direct
connectivity to the metadata database, and local access to the
managed Git repositories.
