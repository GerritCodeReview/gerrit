== NAME
passwd - Set or reset password in secure.config.

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
--
_java_ -jar gerrit.war _passwd_
  -d <SITE_PATH>
  <SECTION.KEY>
  [PASSWORD]

--

== DESCRIPTION
Set or reset password in an existing Gerrit server installation,
interactively prompting for a new password or using the one
provided in the command line argument.

== OPTIONS

-d::
--site-path::
	Location of the `gerrit.config` file, and all other per-site
	configuration data, supporting libraries and log files.

== ARGUMENTS

SECTION.KEY::
	Section and key in the `secure.config` file for setting or editing the
	password value.

PASSWORD::
	New password to set in `secure.config` associated to the section and key.
	When specified as argument, automatically implies batch mode and the command
	would not ask anything interactively.

== CONTEXT

This utility is typically useful when a secure store is configured
to encrypt password values and thus editing the file manually is not an option.
