Gerrit Code Review - Project Documentation
==========================================

If projects contain documentation as Markdown files Gerrit
automatically serves the generated HTML under
`/doc/<project-name>/<file-name>`. The project name and the file name
must be URL encoded.

The file is served from the branch to which `HEAD` points unless a
revision is specified by the `rev` URL parameter, e.g.
`/doc/external%2Fopenssl/docs%2Ffaq.html?rev=stable-1.3`.

If the file name is omitted Gerrit serves the `README.md` from the
project if available.
