Gerrit Code Review - Project Documentation
==========================================

If projects contain documentation as Markdown files, Gerrit
automatically serves the generated HTML under
`/doc/<project-name>/<file-name>`. The project name and the file name
must be URL encoded.

The file is served from the branch/commit to which `HEAD` points unless
a revision is specified by the `rev` URL parameter, e.g.
`/doc/external%2Fopenssl/docs%2Ffaq.html?rev=stable-1.3`.

`rev` can be any ref or commit that is visible to the calling user.

If the file name is omitted Gerrit serves the `README.md` from the
project if available.

*WARNING:* All HTML blocks as well as inline HTML tags are suppressed.
Both will be accepted in the input but not be contained in the output.

*WARNING:* This is an experimental feature in Gerrit which must be
switched on by the site administrator by setting
link:config-gerrit.html#site.enableProjectDocs[site.enableProjectDocs]
in the `gerrit.config` file.
