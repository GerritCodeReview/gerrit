Gerrit Code Review - Project Documentation
==========================================

If projects contain documentation as Markdown files, Gerrit
automatically serves the generated HTML under
`/doc/<project-name>/<file-name>`. The project name and the file name
must be URL encoded.

The file is served from the branch/commit to which `HEAD` points unless
a revision is specified in the URL as
`/src/<project-name>/rev/<rev>/<file-name>`.

====
  /src/external%2Fopenssl/rev/stable-1.3/docs%2Ffaq.md
====

`rev` can be any ref or commit that is visible to the calling user.

If the file name is omitted Gerrit serves the `README.md` from the
project if available.

*WARNING:* HTML blocks as well as inline HTML tags may be suppressed by
the site administrator by setting
link:config-gerrit.html#site.suppressHtml[site.suppressHtml]. If HTML
is suppressed it is accepted in the input but will not be contained in
the output.

*WARNING:* This is an experimental feature in Gerrit which must be
switched on by the site administrator by setting
link:config-gerrit.html#site.enableSrcToMarkdown[site.enableSrcToMarkdown]
in the `gerrit.config` file.
