= Gerrit Code Review - Project Configuration

== Create Through SSH

Creating a new repository over SSH is perhaps the easiest way to
configure a new project:

====
  ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit create-project --name new/project
====

See link:cmd-create-project.html[gerrit create-project] for more
details.


== Manual Creation

Projects may also be manually created.

=== Create Git Repository

Create a Git repository under gerrit.basePath:

====
  git --git-dir=$base_path/new/project.git init
====

[TIP]
By tradition the repository directory name should have a `.git`
suffix.

To also make this repository available over the anonymous git://
protocol, don't forget to create a `git-daemon-export-ok` file:

====
  touch $base_path/new/project.git/git-daemon-export-ok
====

=== Register Project

Either restart the server, or flush the `project_list` cache:

====
  ssh -p 29418 localhost gerrit flush-caches --cache project_list
====

[[submit_type]]
=== Submit Type

The method Gerrit uses to submit a change to a project can be
modified by any project owner through the project console, `Projects` >
`List` > my/project.  The following methods are supported:

* Fast Forward Only
+
This method produces a strictly linear history.  All merges must
be handled on the client, prior to uploading to Gerrit for review.
+
To submit a change, the change must be a strict superset of the
destination branch.  That is, the change must already contain the
tip of the destination branch at submit time.

* Merge If Necessary
+
This is the default for a new project.
+
If the change being submitted is a strict superset of the destination
branch, then the branch is fast-forwarded to the change.  If not,
then a merge commit is automatically created.  This is identical
to the classical `git merge` behavior, or `git merge --ff`.

* Always Merge
+
Always produce a merge commit, even if the change is a strict
superset of the destination branch.  This is identical to the
behavior of `git merge --no-ff`, and may be useful if the
project needs to follow submits with `git log --first-parent`.

* Cherry Pick
+
Always cherry pick the patch set, ignoring the parent lineage
and instead creating a brand new commit on top of the current
branch head.
+
When cherry picking a change, Gerrit automatically appends onto the
end of the commit message a short summary of the change's approvals,
and a URL link back to the change on the web.  The committer header
is also set to the submitter, while the author header retains the
original patch set author.
+
Note that Gerrit ignores patch set dependencies when operating in
cherry-pick mode. Submitters must remember to submit changes in
the right order since inter-change dependencies will not be
enforced for them.

[[rebase_if_necessary]]
* Rebase If Necessary
+
If the change being submitted is a strict superset of the destination
branch, then the branch is fast-forwarded to the change.  If not,
then the change is automatically rebased and then the branch is
fast-forwarded to the change.

When Gerrit tries to do a merge, by default the merge will only
succeed if there is no path conflict.  A path conflict occurs when
the same file has also been changed on the other side of the merge.

If `Automatically resolve conflicts` is enabled, Gerrit will try
to do a content merge when a path conflict occurs.

=== State

This setting defines the state of the project. A project can have the
following states:

- `Active`:
+
The project is active and users can see and modify the project according
to their access rights on the project.

- `Read Only`:
+
The project is read only and all modifying operations on it are
disabled. E.g. this means that pushing to this project fails for all
users even if they have push permissions assigned on it.
+
Setting a project to this state is an easy way to temporary close a
project, as you can keep all write access rights in place and they will
become active again as soon as the project state is set back to
`Active`.
+
This state also makes sense if a project was moved to another location.
In this case all new development should happen in the new project and
you want to prevent that somebody accidentally works on the old
project, while keeping the old project around for old references.

- `Hidden`:
+
The project is hidden and only visible to project owners. Other users
are not able to see the project even if they have read permissions
granted on the project.

=== Require Change-Id

The `Require Change-Id in commit message` option defines whether a
link:user-changeid.html[Change-Id] in the commit message is required
for pushing a commit for review. If this option is set, trying to push
a commit for review that doesn't contain a Change-Id in the commit
message fails with link:error-missing-change-id.html[missing Change-Id
in commit message footer].

It is recommended to set this option and use a
link:user-changeid.html#create[commit-msg hook] (or other client side
tooling like EGit) to automatically generate Change-Id's for new
commits. This way the Change-Id is automatically in place when changes
are reworked or rebased and uploading new patch sets gets easy.

If this option is not set, commits can be uploaded without a Change-Id,
but then users have to remember to copy the assigned Change-Id from the
change screen and insert it manually into the commit message when they
want to upload a second patch set.

=== Maximum Git Object Size Limit

This option defines the maximum allowed Git object size that
receive-pack will accept. If an object is larger than the given size
the pack-parsing will abort and the push operation will fail.

With this option users can be prevented from uploading commits that
contain files which are too large.

Normally the link:config-gerrit.html#receive.maxObjectSizeLimit[maximum
Git object size limit] is configured globally for a Gerrit server. At
the project level, the maximum Git object size limit can be further
reduced, but not extended. The displayed effective limit shows the
maximum Git object size limit that is actually used on the project.

The defined maximum Git object size limit is inherited by any child
project.

=== Require Signed-off-by

The `Require Signed-off-by in commit message` option defines whether a
link:user-signedoffby.html[Signed-off-by] line in the commit message is
required for pushing a commit. If this option is set, trying to push a
commit that doesn't contain a Signed-off-by line in the commit message
fails with link:error-not-signed-off-by.html[not Signed-off-by
author/committer/uploader in commit message footer].

== Registering Additional Branches

Branches can be created over the SSH port by any `git push` client,
if the user has been granted the `Create Reference` access right.

Additional branches can also be created through the web UI, assuming
at least one commit already exists in the project repository.
A project owner can create additional branches under `Projects` >
`List` > my/project > `Branches`.  Enter the new branch name, and the
starting Git revision.  Branch names that don't start with `refs/`
will automatically have `refs/heads/` prefixed to ensure they are
a standard Git branch name.  Almost any valid SHA-1 expression can
be used to specify the starting revision, so long as it resolves
to a commit object.  Abbreviated SHA-1s are not supported.
