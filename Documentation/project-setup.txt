Gerrit2 - Project Configuration
===============================

All Git repositories under `site_path` must be registered in the
Gerrit database in order to be accessed through SSH, or through
the web interface.

Create Git Repository
---------------------

Create a Git repository under `git_base_path`:

====
  git --git-dir=$git_base_pathgit/new/project.git init
====

[TIP]
By tradition the project name should have a `.git` suffix.

To also make this repository available over the anonymous git://
protocol, don't forget the git-daemon-export-ok file:

====
  touch $git_base_pathgit/new/project.git/git-daemon-export-ok
====

Register Project
----------------

At least two inserts are needed to register a project with Gerrit:
one to define the project exists, and another to define a branch
that changes can be uploaded to.  Additional branches may be
defined if desired.

[NOTE]
Note that the `.git` suffix is not typically included in the
project name, as it looks cleaner in the web when not shown.
Gerrit automatically assumes that `project.git` is the Git repository
for a project named `project`.

====
  psql reviewdb
  INSERT INTO projects
  (project_id
   ,use_contributor_agreements
   ,submit_type
   ,owner_group_id
   ,name)
  VALUES
  (nextval('project_id')
  ,'Y'
  ,'M'
  ,(SELECT admin_group_id FROM system_config)
  ,'new/project');

  INSERT INTO branches
  (branch_id
  ,branch_name
  ,project_name)
  VALUES
  (nextval('branch_id')
  ,'refs/heads/master'
  ,'new/project');
====

Registering Additional Branches
-------------------------------

Branches can be created over the SSH port by any `git push` client,
if the user has been granted the `Push Branch` > `Create Branch`
(or higher) access right.

Additional branches can also be created through the web UI, assuming
at least one commit already exists in the project repository.
A project owner can create additional branches under `Admin` >
`Projects` > `Branches`.  Enter the new branch name, and the
starting Git revision.  Branch names that don't start with `refs/`
will automatically have `refs/heads/` prefixed to ensure they are
a standard Git branch name.  Almost any valid SHA-1 expression can
be used to specify the starting revision, so long as it resolves
to a commit object.  Abbreviated SHA-1s are not supported.
