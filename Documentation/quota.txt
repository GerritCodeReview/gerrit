= Gerrit Code Review - Quota

Gerrit does not provide out of the box quota enforcement. However, it does
support an extension mechanism for plugins to hook into to provide this
functionality. The most prominent plugin is the
link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/quota/[Quota Plugin].

This documentation is intended to be read by plugin developers. It contains all
quota requests implemented in Gerrit-core as well as the metadata that they have
associated.

== Quota Groups

The following quota groups are defined in core Gerrit:

=== General

TODO(hiesel,luca.milanesio,matthias.sohn,david.pursehouse): Add more :)

=== REST API

TODO(hiesel,luca.milanesio,matthias.sohn,david.pursehouse): Add more :)

=== Account

TODO(hiesel,luca.milanesio,matthias.sohn,david.pursehouse): The following
check isn't actually implemented, but is a template for how to document
quota requests.

[options="header",cols="1,4"]
|=========================
|Group       |`/accounts/emails/validate`
|Metadata    |CurrentUser, Account.Id
