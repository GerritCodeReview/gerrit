= Gerrit Code Review - Repository Maintenance

== Description

Each project in Gerrit is stored in a bare git repository. Gerrit uses
the jgit library to access (read and write to) these Git repositories.
As modifications are made to a project, Git repository maintenance will
be needed or performance will eventually suffer. When using the Git
command line tool to operate on a Git repository, it will run `git gc`
every now and then on the repository to ensure that Git garbage
collection is performed. However regular maintenance does not happen as
a result of normal Gerrit operations, so this is something that Gerrit
administrators need to plan for.

Gerrit has a built-in feature which allows it to run Git garbage
collection on repositories. This can be
link:config-gerrit.html#gc[conifgured] to run on a regular basis, and/or
this can be run manually with the link:cmd-gc.html[gerrit gc] ssh
command. Some administrators will opt to run `git gc` or `jgit gc`
outside of Gerrit instead. There are many reasons this might be done,
the main one likely being that when it is run in Gerrit it can be very
resource intensive and scheduling an external job to run Git garbage
collection allows administrators to finely tune the approach and
resource usage of this maintenance.
