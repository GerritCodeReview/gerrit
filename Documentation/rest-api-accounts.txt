Gerrit Code Review - '/accounts/' REST API
==========================================

This page describes the account related REST endpoints.
Please also take note of the general information on the
link:rest-api.html[REST API].

Endpoints
---------

[[accounts_self_capabilities]]
GET /accounts/self/capabilities (Account Capabilities)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns the global capabilities (such as `createProject` or
`createGroup`) that are enabled for the calling user. This can be used
by UI tools to discover if administrative features are available
to the caller, so they can hide (or show) relevant UI actions.

.Request
----
  GET /accounts/self/capabilities HTTP/1.0

.Response
----
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Disposition: attachment
  Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

      "max": 500
    }

  {
    "administrateServer": true,
    "queryLimit": {
      "min": 0,
      "max": 500
    },
    "createAccount": true,
    "createGroup": true,
    "createProject": true,
    "killTask": true,

    "flushCaches": true,

    "startReplication": true
  }

.Get your own capabilities
****
get::/accounts/self/capabilities
****

To filter the set of global capabilities the `q` parameter can be used.
Filtering may decrease the response time by avoiding looking at every
possible alternative for the caller.

.Request
----
  GET /a/accounts/self/capabilities?q=createAccount&q=createGroup HTTP/1.0
  Authorization: Digest username="admin", realm="Gerrit Code Review", nonce="...
----

.Response
----
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Disposition: attachment
  Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

  )]}'
  {
    "createAccount": true,
    "createGroup": true
  }
----

Most results are boolean, and a field is only present when its value
is `true`. link:json.html#queryLimit[`queryLimit`] is a range and is
presented as a nested JSON object with `min` and `max` members.

.Check if you can create groups
****
get::/accounts/self/capabilities?q=createGroup
