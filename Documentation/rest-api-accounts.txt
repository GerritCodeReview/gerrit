This page describes the account related REST endpoints.
Please also take note of the general information on the
link:rest-api.html[REST API].

[[account-endpoints]]
== Account Endpoints

[[query-account]]
=== Query Account
--
'GET /accounts/'
--

Queries accounts visible to the caller. The
link:user-search-accounts.html#_search_operators[query string] must be
provided by the `q` parameter. The `n` parameter can be used to limit
the returned results.

As result a list of link:#account-info[AccountInfo] entities is
returned.

.Request
----
  GET /accounts/?q=name:John+email:example.com&n=2 HTTP/1.0
----

.Response
----
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Disposition: attachment

    {
      "_account_id": 1000096,
    },
    {
      "_account_id": 1001439,
      "_more_accounts": true
    }
  ]
----

If the number of accounts matching the query exceeds either the
internal limit or a supplied `n` query parameter, the last account
object has a `_more_accounts: true` JSON field set.

The `S` or `start` query parameter can be supplied to skip a number
of accounts from the list.

Additional fields can be obtained by adding `o` parameters, each
option slows down the query response time to the client so they are
generally disabled by default. Optional fields are:

[[details]]
--
* `DETAILS`: Includes full name, preferred email, username, avatars,
status and state for each account.
--

[[all-emails]]
--
* `ALL_EMAILS`: Includes all registered emails. Requires the caller
to have the link:access-control.html#capability_modifyAccount[Modify
Account] global capability.
--

[[suggest-account]]
To get account suggestions set the parameter `suggest` and provide the
typed substring as query `q`. If a result limit `n` is not specified,
then the default 10 is used.

For account suggestions link:#details[account details] and
link:#all-emails[all emails] are always returned.

.Request
----
  GET /accounts/?suggest&q=John HTTP/1.0
----

Secondary emails are only included if the calling user has the
link:access-control.html#capability_modifyAccount[Modify Account]
capability.

[[ids]]
== IDs

[[account-id]]
=== \{account-id\}
Identifier that uniquely identifies one account.

This can be:

* `self` or `me` for the calling user
* a bare account ID ("18419")
* an account ID following a name in parentheses ("Full Name (18419)")
* a string of the format "Full Name <email@example.com>"
* just the email address ("email@example")
* a full name ("Full Name")
* a user name ("username")

In all cases, accounts that are not
link:config-gerrit.html#accounts.visibility[visible] to the calling user are not
considered.

In all cases _except_ a bare account ID and `self`/`me`, inactive accounts are
not considered. Inactive accounts should only be referenced by bare ID.

If the input is a bare account ID, this will always resolve to exactly
one account if there is a visible account with that ID, and zero accounts
otherwise. (This is true even in corner cases like a user having a full name
which is exactly a numeric account ID belonging to a different user; such a user
cannot be identified by this number.)

If the identifier is ambiguous or only refers to inactive accounts, the error
message from the API should contain a human-readable description of how to
disambiguate the request.

*Note*: Except as noted above, callers should not rely on the particular
priorities of any of the identifiers in the account resolution algorithm. Any
other formats may be subject to future deprecation. If callers require specific
searching semantics, they should use the link:#query-account[Query Account]
endpoint to resolve a string to one or more accounts, then access the API using
the account ID.

[[capability-id]]
=== \{capability-id\}
Identifier of a global capability. Valid values are all field names of
the link:#capability-info[CapabilityInfo] entity.

[[email-id]]
=== \{email-id\}
An email address, or `preferred` for the preferred email address of the
user.

[[username]]
=== \{username\}
The user name.

The sequence number of the SSH key.

[[gpg-key-id]]
=== \{gpg-key-id\}
A GPG key identifier, either the 8-character hex key reported by
`gpg --list-keys`, or the 40-character hex fingerprint (whitespace is
ignored) reported by `gpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint`.
