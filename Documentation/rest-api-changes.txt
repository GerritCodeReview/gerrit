Queries changes visible to the caller. The
link:user-search.html#_search_operators[query string] must be provided
by the `q` parameter. The `n` parameter can be used to limit the
returned results.

As result a list of link:#change-info[ChangeInfo] entries is returned.

----

If the number of changes matching the query exceeds either the internal
limit or a supplied `n` query parameter, the last change object has a
`_more_changes: true` JSON field set.

The `S` or `start` query parameter can be supplied to skip a number
of changes from the list.

Clients are allowed to specify more than one query by setting the `q`
parameter multiple times. In this case the result is an array of
arrays, one per query in the same order the queries were given in.

[[query-options]]
Additional fields can be obtained by adding `o` parameters, each
option requires more database lookups and slows down the query
response time to the client so they are generally disabled by
default. Optional fields are:

[[labels]]
--
* `LABELS`: a summary of each label required for submit, and
  approvers that have granted (or rejected) with that label.
--

[[detailed-labels]]
--
* `DETAILED_LABELS`: detailed label information, including numeric
  values of all existing approvals, recognized label values, values
  permitted to be set by the current user, all reviewers by state, and
  reviewers that may be removed by the current user.
--

[[current-revision]]
--
* `CURRENT_REVISION`: describe the current revision (patch set)
  of the change, including the commit SHA-1 and URLs to fetch from.
--

[[all-revisions]]
--
* `ALL_REVISIONS`: describe all revisions, not just current.
--

[[download-commands]]
--
* `DOWNLOAD_COMMANDS`: include the `commands` field in the
  link:#fetch-info[FetchInfo] for revisions. Only valid when the
  `CURRENT_REVISION` or `ALL_REVISIONS` option is selected.
--

[[current-commit]]
--
* `CURRENT_COMMIT`: parse and output all header fields from the
  commit object, including message. Only valid when the
  `CURRENT_REVISION` or `ALL_REVISIONS` option is selected.
--

[[all-commits]]
--
* `ALL_COMMITS`: parse and output all header fields from the
  output revisions. If only `CURRENT_REVISION` was requested
  then only the current revision's commit data will be output.
--

[[current-files]]
--
* `CURRENT_FILES`: list files modified by the commit and magic files,
  including basic line counts inserted/deleted per file. Only valid
  when the `CURRENT_REVISION` or `ALL_REVISIONS` option is selected.
--

[[all-files]]
--
* `ALL_FILES`: list files modified by the commit and magic files,
  including basic line counts inserted/deleted per file. If only the
  `CURRENT_REVISION` was requested then only that commit's modified
  files will be output.
--

[[detailed-accounts]]
--
* `DETAILED_ACCOUNTS`: include `_account_id`, `email` and `username`
  fields when referencing accounts.
--

[[reviewer-updates]]
--
* `REVIEWER_UPDATES`: include updates to reviewers set as
  link:#review-update-info[ReviewerUpdateInfo] entities.
--

[[messages]]
--
* `MESSAGES`: include messages associated with the change.
--

[[actions]]
--
* `CURRENT_ACTIONS`: include information on available actions
  for the change and its current revision. Ignored if the caller
  is not authenticated.
--

[[change-actions]]
--
* `CHANGE_ACTIONS`: include information on available
  change actions for the change. Ignored if the caller
  is not authenticated.
--

[[reviewed]]
--
* `REVIEWED`: include the `reviewed` field if all of the following are
  true:
  - the change is open
  - the caller is authenticated
  - the caller has commented on the change more recently than the last update
    from the change owner, i.e. this change would show up in the results of
    link:user-search.html#reviewedby[reviewedby:self].
--

[[skip_mergeable]]
--
* `SKIP_MERGEABLE`: skip the `mergeable` field in
link:#change-info[ChangeInfo]. For fast moving projects, this field must
be recomputed often, which is slow for projects with big trees.
+
When link:config-gerrit.html#change.api.excludeMergeableInChangeInfo[
`change.api.excludeMergeableInChangeInfo`] is set in the `gerrit.config`,
the `mergeable` field will always be omitted and `SKIP_MERGEABLE` has no
effect.
+
A change's mergeability can be requested separately by calling the
link:#get-mergeable[get-mergeable] endpoint.
--
[[skip_diffstat]]
--
* `SKIP_DIFFSTAT`: skip the 'insertions' and 'deletions' field in link:#change-info[ChangeInfo].
 For large trees, their computation may be expensive.
--

[[submittable]]
--
* `SUBMITTABLE`: include the `submittable` field in link:#change-info[ChangeInfo],
  which can be used to tell if the change is reviewed and ready for submit.
--

[[web-links]]
--
* `WEB_LINKS`: include the `web_links` field in link:#commit-info[CommitInfo],
  therefore only valid in combination with `CURRENT_COMMIT` or
  `ALL_COMMITS`.
--

[[check]]
--
* `CHECK`: include potential problems with the change.
--

[[commit-footers]]
--
* `COMMIT_FOOTERS`: include the full commit message with
  Gerrit-specific commit footers in the
  link:#revision-info[RevisionInfo].
--

[[push-certificates]]
--
* `PUSH_CERTIFICATES`: include push certificate information in the
  link:#revision-info[RevisionInfo]. Ignored if signed push is not
  link:config-gerrit.html#receive.enableSignedPush[enabled] on the
  server.
--

[[tracking-ids]]
--
* `TRACKING_IDS`: include references to external tracking systems
  as link:#tracking-id-info[TrackingIdInfo].
--

[[no-limit]]
--
* `NO-LIMIT`: Return all results

The Content-Type header will always be `text/plain` reflecting the
outer base64 encoding. A Gerrit-specific `X-FYI-Content-Type` header
can be examined to find the server detected content type of the file.

When the specified file was deleted in the change edit
"`204 No Content`" is returned.

If only the content type is required, callers should use HEAD to
avoid downloading the encoded file contents.

If the `base` parameter is set to true, the returned content is from the
revision that the edit is based on.

If a group is specified, adding the group members as reviewers is an
atomic operation. This means if an error is returned, none of the
members are added as reviewer.

If a group with many members is added as reviewer a confirmation may be
required.

If a group is added as CC and members of this group are already
reviewers on the change, these members stay reviewers on the change
(they are not downgraded to CC). However if a group is added as
reviewer, all group members become reviewer of the change, even if they
have been added as CC before.

don't have a Gerrit account.

If this option is disabled, the request would fail with `400 Bad Request` if the email
address can't be resolved to an active Gerrit account.

[[set-review-notifications]]
.Notifications

An email will be sent using the "comment" template.

If the top-level notify property is null or not set, then notification behavior
depends on whether the change is WIP, whether it has started review, and whether
the tag property is null.

NOTE: If adding reviewers, the notify property of each ReviewerInput is *ignored*.
Use the notify property of the top-level link:#review-input[ReviewInput] instead.

For the purposes of this table, *everyone* means *owner, reviewers, CCs, stars, and ALL_COMMENTS
watchers*.

[options="header",cols="2,1,1,2,2"]

If reviewers are added, then a second email will be sent using the "newchange"

link:#add-reviewer[Add Reviewer].

[[get-patch]]
=== Get Patch

'GET /changes/link:#change-id[\{change-id\}]/revisions/link:#revision-id[\{revision-id\}]/patch'
--

Gets the formatted patch for one revision.

.Request
----
  GET /changes/myProject~master~I8473b95934b5732ac55d26311a706c9c2bde9940/revisions/current/patch HTTP/1.0
----

The formatted patch is returned as text encoded inside base64:

.Response
----
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Disposition: attachment
  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

  X-FYI-Content-Type: application/mbox

  RnJvbSA3ZGFkY2MxNTNmZGVhMTdhYTg0ZmYzMmE2ZTI0NWRiYjY...
----

Adding query parameter `zip` (for example `/changes/.../patch?zip`)
returns the patch as a single file inside of a ZIP archive. Clients
can expand the ZIP to obtain the plain text patch, avoiding the
need for a base64 decoding step. This option implies `download`.

Query parameter `download` (e.g. `/changes/.../patch?download`)
will suggest the browser save the patch as `commitsha1.diff.base64`,
for later processing by command line tools.

If the `path` parameter is set, the returned content is a diff of the single
file that the path refers to.

[[submit-preview]]
=== Submit Preview
--
'GET /changes/link:#change-id[\{change-id\}]/revisions/link:#revision-id[\{revision-id\}]/preview_submit'
--
Gets a file containing thin bundles of all modified projects if this
change was submitted. The bundles are named `${ProjectName}.git`.
Each thin bundle contains enough to construct the state in which a project would
be in if this change were submitted. The base of the thin bundles are the
current target branches, so to make use of this call in a non-racy way, first
get the bundles and then fetch all projects contained in the bundle.
(This assumes no non-fastforward pushes).

You need to give a parameter '?format=zip' or '?format=tar' to specify the
format for the outer container. It is always possible to use tgz, even if
tgz is not in the list of allowed archive formats.

To make good use of this call, you would roughly need code as found at:

--

Deletes a published comment of a revision. Instead of deleting the
whole comment, this endpoint just replaces the comment's message
with a new message, which contains the name of the user who deletes
the comment and the reason why it's deleted.

Note that only users with the
link:access-control.html#capability_administrateServer[Administrate Server]
global capability are permitted to delete a comment.

Deletion reason can be provided in the request body as a
link:#delete-comment-input[DeleteCommentInput] entity.
Historically, this method allowed a body in the DELETE, but that behavior is
link:https://www.gerritcodereview.com/releases/2.16.md[deprecated].
In this case, use a POST request instead:

The request parameter `reviewed` changes the response to return a list
of the paths the caller has marked as reviewed.  Clients that also
need the FileInfo should make two requests.

The request parameter `q` changes the response to return a list
of all files (modified or unmodified) that contain that substring
in the path name. This is useful to implement suggestion services
finding a file by partial name.  Clients that also need the FileInfo
should make two requests.

For merge commits only, the integer-valued request parameter `parent`
changes the response to return a map of the files which are different
in this commit compared to the given parent commit. The value is the
1-based index of the parent's position in the commit object,
with the first parent always belonging to the target branch. If not
specified, the response contains a map of the files different in the
auto merge result.

The request parameter `base` changes the response to return a map of the
files which are different in this commit compared to the given revision. The
revision must correspond to a patch set in the change.

The `reviewed`, `q`, `parent`, and `base` options are mutually exclusive.
That is, only one of them may be used at a time.

--

Gets the content of a file from a certain revision.

The optional, integer-valued `parent` parameter can be specified to request
the named file from a parent commit of the specified revision. The value is
the 1-based index of the parent's position in the commit object. If the
parameter is omitted or the value is non-positive, the patch set is referenced.

----

The content is returned as base64 encoded string.  The HTTP response
Content-Type is always `text/plain`, reflecting the base64 wrapping.
A Gerrit-specific `X-FYI-Content-Type` header is returned describing
the server detected content type of the file.

If only the content type is required, callers should use HEAD to
avoid downloading the encoded file contents.

=== Download Content
--
'GET /changes/link:#change-id[\{change-id\}]/revisions/link:#revision-id[\{revision-id\}]/files/link:#file-id[\{file-id\}]/download'
--

Downloads the content of a file from a certain revision, in a safe format
that poses no risk for inadvertent execution of untrusted code.

If the content type is defined as safe, the binary file content is returned
verbatim. If the content type is not safe, the file is stored inside a ZIP
file, containing a single entry with a random, unpredictable name having the
same base and suffix as the true filename. The ZIP file is returned in
verbatim binary form.

See link:config-gerrit.html#mimetype.name.safe[Gerrit config documentation]
for information about safe file type configuration.

The HTTP resource Content-Type is dependent on the file type: the
applicable type for safe files, or "application/zip" for unsafe files.

The optional, integer-valued `parent` parameter can be specified to request
the named file from a parent commit of the specified revision. The value is
the 1-based index of the parent's position in the commit object. If the
parameter is omitted or the value non-positive, the patch set is referenced.

Filenames are decorated with a suffix of `_new` for the current patch,
`_old` for the only parent, or `_oldN` for the Nth parent of many.

[[change-id]]
=== \{change-id\}
Identifier that uniquely identifies one change. It contains the URL-encoded
project name as well as the change number: "'$$<project>~<numericId>$$'"

Depending on the server's configuration, Gerrit can still support the following
deprecated identifiers. These will be removed in a future release:

* an ID of the change in the format "'$$<project>~<branch>~<Change-Id>$$'",
  where for the branch the `refs/heads/` prefix can be omitted
  ("$$myProject~master~I8473b95934b5732ac55d26311a706c9c2bde9940$$")
* a Change-Id if it uniquely identifies one change
  ("I8473b95934b5732ac55d26311a706c9c2bde9940")
* a numeric change ID ("4247")

If you need more time to migrate off of old change IDs, please see

The commit message and headers with the parent commit(s), the author
information and the committer information.

* `/MERGE_LIST` (for merge commits only):
+
The list of commits that are being integrated into the destination
branch by submitting the merge commit.

[[fix-id]]
=== \{fix-id\}
UUID of a suggested fix.

[[revision-id]]
=== \{revision-id\}
Identifier that uniquely identifies one revision of a change.

This can be:

* the literal `current` to name the current patch set/revision
* a commit ID ("674ac754f91e64a0efb8087e59a176484bd534d1")
* an abbreviated commit ID that uniquely identifies one revision of the
  change ("674ac754"), at least 4 digits are required
* a legacy numeric patch number ("1" for first patch set of the change)
* "0" or the literal `edit` for a change edit
