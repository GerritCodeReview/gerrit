'GET /changes/'
--

Queries changes visible to the caller. The
link:user-search.html#_search_operators[query string] must be provided
by the `q` parameter. The `n` parameter can be used to limit the
returned results.

As result a list of link:#change-info[ChangeInfo] entries is returned.
The change output is sorted by the last update time, most recently
updated to oldest updated.

Query for open changes of watched projects:

----

If the `n` query parameter is supplied and additional changes exist
that match the query beyond the end, the last change object has a
`_more_changes: true` JSON field set. Callers can resume a query with
the `N` query parameter, supplying the last change's `_sortkey` field
as the value. When going in the reverse direction with the `P` query
parameter a `_more_changes: true` is put in the first change object if
there are results *before* the first change returned.

Clients are allowed to specify more than one query by setting the `q`
parameter multiple times. In this case the result is an array of
arrays, one per query in the same order the queries were given in.

Additional fields can be obtained by adding `o` parameters, each
option requires more database lookups and slows down the query
response time to the client so they are generally disabled by
default. Optional fields are:

[[labels]]
--
* `LABELS`: a summary of each label required for submit, and
  approvers that have granted (or rejected) with that label.
--

[[detailed-labels]]
--
* `DETAILED_LABELS`: detailed label information, including numeric
  values of all existing approvals, recognized label values, values
  permitted to be set by the current user, and reviewers that may be
  removed by the current user.
--

[[current-revision]]
--
* `CURRENT_REVISION`: describe the current revision (patch set)
  of the change, including the commit SHA-1 and URLs to fetch from.
--

[[all-revisions]]
--
* `ALL_REVISIONS`: describe all revisions, not just current.
--

[[download_commands]]
--
* `DOWNLOAD_COMMANDS`: include the `commands` field in the
  link:#fetch-info[FetchInfo] for revisions. Only valid when the
  `CURRENT_REVISION` or `ALL_REVISIONS` option is selected.
--

[[draft_comments]]
--
* `DRAFT_COMMENTS`: include the `has_draft_comments` field for
  revisions. Only valid when the `CURRENT_REVISION` or `ALL_REVISIONS`
  option is selected.
--

[[current-commit]]
--
* `CURRENT_COMMIT`: parse and output all header fields from the
  commit object, including message. Only valid when the
  `CURRENT_REVISION` or `ALL_REVISIONS` option is selected.
--

[[all-commits]]
--
* `ALL_COMMITS`: parse and output all header fields from the
  output revisions. If only `CURRENT_REVISION` was requested
  then only the current revision's commit data will be output.
--

[[current-files]]
--
* `CURRENT_FILES`: list files modified by the commit, including
  basic line counts inserted/deleted per file. Only valid when
  the `CURRENT_REVISION` or `ALL_REVISIONS` option is selected.
--

[[all-files]]
--
* `ALL_FILES`: list files modified by the commit, including
  basic line counts inserted/deleted per file. If only the
  `CURRENT_REVISION` was requested then only that commit's
  modified files will be output.
--

[[detailed-accounts]]
--
* `DETAILED_ACCOUNTS`: include `_account_id`, `email` and `username`
  fields when referencing accounts.
--

[[messages]]
--
* `MESSAGES`: include messages associated with the change.
--

[[actions]]
--
* `CURRENT_ACTIONS`: include information on available actions
  for the change and its current revision. The caller must be
  authenticated to obtain the available actions.
--

[[reviewed]]
--
* `REVIEWED`: include the `reviewed` field if the caller is
  authenticated and has commented on the current revision.
--

[[patch-set-links]]
--
* `PATCHSET_LINKS`: include the `web_links` field.
--

can expand the ZIP to obtain the plain text patch, avoiding the
need for a base64 decoding step. This option implies `download`.

will suggest the browser save the patch as `commitsha1.diff.base64`,
for later processing by command line tools.
