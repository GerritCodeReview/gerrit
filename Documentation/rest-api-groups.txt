'GET /groups/'

by group name.

[[group-options]]
==== Group Options
Additional fields can be obtained by adding `o` parameters, each option
requires more lookups and slows down the query response time to the
client so they are generally disabled by default. Optional fields are:

[[includes]]

* `INCLUDES`: include list of directly included groups.
--

[[members]]
--
* `MEMBERS`: include list of direct group members.
--

==== Check if a group is owned by the calling user
By setting the option `owned` and specifying a group to inspect with
the option `q`, it is possible to find out, if this group is owned by
the calling user.

.Request
----
  GET /groups/?owned&q=MyProject-Committers HTTP/1.0
