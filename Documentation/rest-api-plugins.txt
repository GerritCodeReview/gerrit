= Gerrit Code Review - /plugins/ REST API

This page describes the plugin related REST endpoints.
Please also take note of the general information on the
link:rest-api.html[REST API].

[[plugin-endpoints]]
== Plugin Endpoints

Gerrit REST endpoints for installed plugins are available under
'/plugins/link:#plugin-id[\{plugin-id\}]/gerrit~<endpoint-id>'.
The `gerrit~` prefix ensures that the Gerrit REST endpoints for plugins
do not clash with any REST endpoint that a plugin may offer under its
namespace.


[[list-plugins]]
=== List Plugins
--
'GET /plugins/'
--

Lists the plugins installed on the Gerrit server. Only the enabled
plugins are returned unless the `all` option is specified.

To be allowed to see the installed plugins, a user must be a member of
a group that is granted the 'View Plugins' capability or the
'Administrate Server' capability.

As result a map is returned that maps the plugin IDs to
link:#plugin-info[PluginInfo] entries. The entries in the map are sorted
by plugin ID.

or a URL to the plugin jar must be provided in the request body inside
a link:#plugin-input[PluginInput] entity.

----
  PUT /plugins/delete-project HTTP/1.0
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

  }

following curl command can be used:

----
  curl --user admin:TNNuLkWsIV8w -X PUT --data-binary @delete-project-2.8.jar 'http://gerrit:8080/a/plugins/delete-project'
----

As response a link:#plugin-info[PluginInfo] entity is returned that
describes the plugin.

----
  HTTP/1.1 201 Created
  Content-Disposition: attachment
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
