by project name.

==== Asynchronous Execution

The option `async` allows to schedule a background task that asynchronously
executes a Git garbage collection.

The `Location` header of the response refers to the link:rest-api-config.html#get-task[background task]
which allows to inspect the progress of its execution. In case of asynchronous
execution the `show_progress` option is ignored.

[[ban-commit]]
=== Ban Commit
--
'PUT /projects/link:#project-name[\{project-name\}]/ban'
--

Marks commits as banned for the project. If a commit is banned Gerrit
rejects every push that includes this commit with
link:error-contains-banned-commit.html[contains banned commit ...].

[NOTE]
This REST endpoint only marks the commits as banned, but it does not
remove the commits from the history of any central branch. This needs
to be done manually.

The commits to be banned must be specified in the request body as a
link:#ban-input[BanInput] entity.

The caller must be project owner.

[[set-access]]
=== Add, Update and Delete Access Rights for Project
--
'POST /projects/link:rest-api-projects.html#project-name[\{project-name\}]/access'
--

Sets access rights for the project using the diff schema provided by
link:#project-access-input[ProjectAccessInput]. Deductions are used to
remove access sections, permissions or permission rules. The backend will remove
the entity with the finest granularity in the request, meaning that if an
access section without permissions is posted, the access section will be
removed; if an access section with a permission but no permission rules is
posted, the permission will be removed; if an access section with a permission
and a permission rule is posted, the permission rule will be removed.

Additionally, access sections and permissions will be cleaned up after applying
the deductions by removing items that have no child elements.

After removals have been applied, additions will be applied.

As result a
link:rest-api-access.html#project-access-info[ProjectAccessInfo]
entity is returned.

[[check]]
=== Check project consistency

Performs consistency checks on the project.

Which consistency checks should be performed is controlled by the
link:#check-project-input[CheckProjectInput] entity in the request
body.

The following consistency checks are supported:

[[auto-closeable-changes-check]]
--
* AutoCloseableChangesCheck: Searches for open changes that can be
  auto-closed because a patch set of the change is already contained in
  the destination branch or because the destination branch contains a
  commit with the same Change-Id. Normally Gerrit auto-closes such
  changes when the corresponding commits are pushed directly to the
  repository. However if a branch is updated behind Gerrit's back or if
  auto-closing changes fails (and the push is still successful) change
  states can get inconsistent (changes that are already part of the
  destination branch are still open). This consistency check is
  intended to detect and repair this situation.
--

To fix any problems that can be fixed automatically set the `fix` field
in the inputs for the consistency checks  to `true`.

This REST endpoint requires the
link:access-control.html#capability_administrateServer[Administrate Server]
global capability.
