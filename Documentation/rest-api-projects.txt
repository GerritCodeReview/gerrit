Gerrit Code Review - '/projects/' REST API
==========================================

This page describes the project related REST endpoints.
Please also take note of the general information on the
link:rest-api.html[REST API].

Endpoints
---------

GET /projects/ (List Projects)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lists the projects accessible by the caller. This is the same as
using the link:cmd-ls-projects.html[ls-projects] command over SSH,
and accepts the same options as query parameters.

As result a map is returned that maps the project names to
link:#project-info[ProjectInfo] entries. The entries in the map are sorted
by project name.
