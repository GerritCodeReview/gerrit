= Gerrit Code Review - Change Cleanup

Gerrit administrators may configure
link:config-gerrit.html#changeCleanup[change cleanups] that are
executed periodically.

[[auto-abandon]]
== Auto-Abandon

This cleanup job automatically abandons open changes that have been
inactive for a defined time.

Abandoning old inactive changes has the following advantages:

* it signals change authors that changes are considered outdated
* it keeps dashboards clean
* it reduces the load on the server (for open changes the mergeability
  flag is recomputed whenever a change is merged)

If a change is still wanted it can be restored by clicking on the
`Restore` button.

[[auto-rebase]]
== Auto-Rebase

This cleanup job automatically rebases open changes that have been
inactive for a defined time and that are still mergeable.

Rebasing old inactive changes has the advantage that they are pushed
back to the top of reviewer dashboards so that they can catch the
attention of reviewers that don't look at old changes.
