= Gerrit Code Review - Change Cleanup

Gerrit administrators may configure
link:config-gerrit.html#changeCleanup[change cleanups] that are
executed periodically.

[[auto-abandon]]
== Auto-Abandon

This cleanup job automatically abandons open and draft changes that have
been inactive for a defined time.

Abandoning old inactive changes has the following advantages:

* it signals change authors that changes are considered outdated
* it keeps dashboards clean
* it reduces the load on the server (for open changes the mergeability
  flag is recomputed whenever a change is merged)

If a change is still wanted it can be restored by clicking on the
`Restore` button.

In the case of a draft change, the most recent patchset is undrafted as
well as the change itself and then it is abandoned. Only the abandoned
event is fired when doing this operation.
