Gerrit Code Review - Dependencies
=================================

Description
-----------

Gerrit Code Review supports cross-project dependencies between changes.
A user may specify such dependencies by using a ChangeTriplet.
To be picked up by Gerrit, a Dependency line must be in the bottom
portion (last paragraph) of a commit message, and may be mixed
together with the Signed-off-by, Acked-by, or other such footers.
For example:

----
  $ git log -1
  commit 29a6bb1a059aef021ac39d342499191278518d1d
  Author: A. U. Thor <author@example.com>
  Date: Thu Aug 20 12:46:50 2009 -0700

      Improve foo widget by attaching a bar.

      We want a bar, because it improves the foo by providing more
      wizbangery to the dowhatimeanery.

      Bug: #42
      Change-Id: Ic8aaa0728a43936cd4c6e1ed590e01ba8f0fbf5b
      Dependency: myotherproject~mybranch~I97abc0ddaa303f57e0ce3deaa8c498917d75774e
      Signed-off-by: A. U. Thor <author@example.com>
      CC: R. E. Viewer <reviewer@example.com>
----

In the above example, `myotherproject` is a project different from the target
project of this commit, `mybranch` is the branch of the dependency, and
`I97abc0ddaa303f57e0ce3deaa8c498917d75774e` is the Change-Id of the dependency.

Circular Dependencies
--------

Given two changes, A and B, one may create a circular dependency by

* uploading a patchset to create A,
* uploading a patchset specifying A as a dependency to create B, and
* uploading a patchset specifying B as a dependency to A.
