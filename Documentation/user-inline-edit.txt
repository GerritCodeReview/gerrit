= Inline Edit

This page explains the workflow for creating and amending changes in the
browser.


[[create-change]]
== Creating a New Empty Change

A new change can be created directly in the browser, meaning it is not necessary
to clone the whole repository to make trivial changes.

There are two different ways to create an empty change:

By clicking on the 'Create Change' button in the project screen:

[[create-change-from-project-info-screen]]

image::images/inline-edit-create-change-project-screen.png[width=800, link="images/inline-edit-create-change-project-screen.png"]

The user can select the branch on which the new change should be created:

image::images/inline-edit-create-change-project-screen-dialog.png[width=800, link="images/inline-edit-create-change-project-screen-dialog.png"]

By clicking the 'Follow-Up' button on the change screen, to create an empty
change based on the selected change.

[[editing-change]]
== Editing Changes

To switch to edit mode, press the 'Edit' button at the top of the file list:

[[switch-to-edit-mode]]
image::images/inline-edit-enter-edit-mode-from-file-list.png[width=800, link="images/inline-edit-enter-edit-mode-from-file-list.png"]

While in edit mode, it is possible to add new files to the change by clicking
the 'Add...' button at the top of the file list.

Files can be removed from the change, or restored, by clicking the icon to the
left of the file name.

To switch from edit mode back to review mode, click the 'Done Editing' button.

[[open-full-screen-editor]]
While in edit mode, clicking on a file name in the file list opens a full
screen editor for that file.

To save or abort edits and return to the change screen, click the 'Save' or
'Cancel' button.

[[switch-to-edit-mode-from-side-by-side]]

While in review mode, it is possible to switch directly to edit mode and into an
editor for a file under review by clicking on the edit icon in the patch set list
on the side-by-side diff view.

image::images/inline-edit-enter-edit-mode-from-diff.png[width=800, link="images/inline-edit-enter-edit-mode-from-diff.png"]

[[reviewing-changes-made-in-change-edit]]
== Reviewing Change Edits

Change edits are reviewed in the same way as regular patch sets, using the
side-by-side diff screen. Change edits are shown as 'edit' in the patch list
on the diff screen:

image::images/inline-edit-edit-in-diff-screen-patch-list.png[width=800, link="images/inline-edit-edit-in-diff-screen-patch-list.png"]

and on the change screen:

image::images/inline-edit-edit-in-patch-list.png[width=800, link="images/inline-edit-edit-in-patch-list.png"]

Note that patch sets may exist that were created after the change edit was created.

For example this sequence:

`1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 edit 10`

means that the change edit was created on top of patch set number 9 and a regular
patch set was uploaded later.

[[change-edit-actions]]
== Change Edit Actions

Change edits can be deleted, published, rebased and patch that represents change
edit can be downloaded like regular patch sets.

[[delete-change-edit]]

Change edit is saved on special ref. When change edit is deleted, this ref is
deleted as well. To delete change edit click on "Delete Edit" button.

[[publish-change-edit]]

When change is based on current patch set, it can be published, meant it get
prompted to regular patch set and the ref, that represents the change edit is
deleted. To publish change edit click on "Publlish Edit" button. When this button
is not visible, then the patch set the edit is based on is not the current patch
set. In this case see next section how to rebase change edit.

[[rebase-change-edit]]

Only change edits that based on the current patch set can be published. When in
the menatime new patch set was uploaded, change edit must be rebased first on top
of current patch set. To do that click on "Rebase Edit". When during rebase conflict
occurs, it currently can bed resolved in browser. In this case the change edit must
be downloaded (see next section) and conflicts must be resolved you user local
environment.

[[download-change-edit-patch]]

Like regular patch sets, change edits can be downloaded with download-command plugin.
Note that this plugin must be installed for this feature to work. To download patch
select the desired scheme from "Download" dropdown and copy the command to your
terminal.

[[missing-features]]
== Not Implemented Features

* Save button in Edit Screen immediately aborts editing. This should be revistied
* Allow to customize CM3 in edit screen per use base (pending)
* Add support for different key maps (Emacs, Vim, Default) (pending)
* Changed files in edit should marked as changed with '*' suffix in file table
* When opened from SBS2, cursor position is lost in Edit Screen
* Allow to upload/amend change edit with `git push`
* Navigation icons (left, up, right)) in edit screen are missing
* Replace/Extend "Add file" dialog:
** implement repository browser in popup dialog -- borrow this feature from
gitiles? -- and/or
** asynchronously index the master (and optionally other branches) and implement
suggest file oracle on top of it: typing "Foo" would suggest
"foo/bar/baz/FooBarBaz.java" and other matches. That would mimic "Ctrl+Shift+T"
Open Type feature in Eclipse
* Implement conflict resolution during rebase of change edit using inline edit
feature by creating new edit on top of current patch set with auto merge content
* Now, that inline edit feature is there, conflict resolution during rebase of
regular pacth set should be implemented on top of it
