= Inline Edit

This page explains the workflow for creating and amending changes in the
browser.


[[create-change]]
== Creating a New Empty Change

A new change can be created directly in the browser, meaning it is not necessary
to clone the whole repository to make trivial changes.

There are two different ways to create an empty change:

By clicking on the 'Create Change' button in the project screen:

[[create-change-from-project-info-screen]]

The user can select the branch on which the new change should be created:

By clicking the 'Follow-Up' button on the change screen, to create an empty
change based on the selected change.

[[editing-change]]
== Editing Changes

To switch to edit mode, press the 'Edit' button at the top of the file list:

[[switch-to-edit-mode]]
image::images/inline-edit-enter-edit-mode-from-file-list.png[width=800, link="images/inline-edit-enter-edit-mode-from-file-list.png"]

While in edit mode, it is possible to add new files to the change by clicking
the 'Add...' button at the top of the file list.

Files can be removed from the change, or restored, by clicking the icon to the
left of the file name.

To switch from edit mode back to review mode, click the 'Done Editing' button.

[[open-full-screen-editor]]
While in edit mode, clicking on a file name in the file list opens a full
screen editor for that file.

To save edits, click the 'Save' button or press `CTRL-S`.  To return to the
change screen, click the 'Close' button.

If there are unsaved edits when the 'Close' button is pressed, a dialog will
pop up asking to confirm the edits.

To discard the unsaved edits and return to the change screen, click the 'OK'
button. To continue editing, click 'Cancel'.

[[switch-to-edit-mode-from-side-by-side]]

While in review mode, it is possible to switch directly to edit mode and into an
editor for a file under review by clicking on the edit icon in the patch set list
on the side-by-side diff view.

[[reviewing-changes-made-in-change-edit]]
== Reviewing Change Edits

Change edits are reviewed in the same way as regular patch sets, using the
side-by-side diff screen. Change edits are shown as 'edit' in the patch list
on the diff screen:

image::images/inline-edit-edit-in-diff-screen-patch-list.png[width=800, link="images/inline-edit-edit-in-diff-screen-patch-list.png"]

and on the change screen:

image::images/inline-edit-edit-in-patch-list.png[width=800, link="images/inline-edit-edit-in-patch-list.png"]

Note that patch sets may exist that were created after the change edit was created.

For example this sequence:

`1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 edit 10`

means that the change edit was created on top of patch set number 9 and a regular
patch set was uploaded later.
