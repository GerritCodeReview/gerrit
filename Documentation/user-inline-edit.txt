This page explains the workflow for creating and amending changes in the
browser.

== Creating a New Empty Change

A new change can be created directly in the browser, meaning it is not necessary
to clone the whole repository to make trivial changes.

There are two different ways to create an empty change:

By clicking on the 'Create Change' button in the project screen:

[[create-change-from-project-info-screen]]

The user can select the branch on which the new change should be created:

By clicking the 'Follow-Up' button on the change screen, to create an empty
change based on the selected change.
