This page explains the workflow for creating and amending changes in the
browser.

== Creating a New Empty Change

A new change can be created directly in the browser, meaning it is not necessary
to clone the whole repository to make trivial changes.

There two different ways to create an empty change:

By clicking on the 'Create Change' button in the project screen, to create an
empty change on the specified branch of the given project.

By clicking the 'Follow-Up' button on the change screen, to create an empty
change based on the selected change.
