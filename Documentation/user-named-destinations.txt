= Gerrit Code Review - Named Destinations

[[user-named-destinations]]
== User Named Destinations
It is possible to define named destination sets on a user level.
To do this, define the named destination sets in files named after
each destination set in the `destinations` directory of the user's
account ref in the `All-Users` project.  The user's account ref is
based on the user's account id which is an integer.  The account
refs are sharded by the last two digits (`+nn+`) in the refname,
leading to refs of the format `+refs/users/nn/accountid+`.  The
user's destination files are a 2 column tab delimited file.  Each
row in a destination file represents a single destination in the
named set.  The left column represents the ref of the destination,
and the right column represents the project of the destination.

Example destination file named `destinations/myreviews`:

----
# Ref            	Project
#
refs/heads/master	gerrit
refs/heads/stable-2.11	gerrit
refs/heads/master	plugins/cookbook-plugin
