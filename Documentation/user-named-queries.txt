== User Or Group Named Queries
It is possible to define named queries on a user or group level. To do
this, define the named queries in the `queries` file under the
link:intro-user.html#user-refs[user's ref] or
link:config-groups.html#_storage_format[group's ref] in the `All-Users`
project. The named queries file is a 2 column tab delimited file. The left
column represents the name of the query, and the right column
represents the query expression represented by the name. The named queries
can be publicly accessible by other users.

Example queries file:

----
# Name         	Query
#
selfapproved   	owner:self label:code-review+2,user=self
blocked        	label:code-review-2 OR label:verified-1
# Note below how to reference your own named queries in other named queries
ready          	label:code-review+2 label:verified+1 -query:blocked status:open
