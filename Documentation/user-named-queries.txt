= Gerrit Code Review - Named Queries

[[user-named-queries]]
== User Named Queries
It is possible to define named queries on a user level. To do
this, define the named queries in the `queries` file under the
link:intro-user.html#user-refs[user's ref] in the `All-Users` project.  The
user's queries file is a 2 column tab delimited file.  The left
column represents the name of the query, and the right column
represents the query expression represented by the name.

Example queries file:

----
# Name         	Query
#
selfapproved   	owner:self label:code-review+2,user=self
blocked        	label:code-review-2 OR label:verified-1
# Note below how to reference your own named queries in other named queries
ready          	label:code-review+2 label:verified+1 -query:blocked status:open
