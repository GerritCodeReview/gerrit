= Gerrit Code Review - Named Queries

[[user-named-queries]]
== User Named Queries
It is possible to define named queries on a user level. To do
this, define the named queries in the `queries` file of
the user's account ref in the `All-Users` project.  The user's
account ref is based on the user's account id which is an
integer.  The account refs are sharded by the last two digits
(`+nn+`) in the refname, leading to refs of the format
`+refs/users/nn/accountid+`.  The user's queries file is a
2 column tab delimited file.  The left column represents the
name of the query, and the right column represents the query
expression represented by the name.

Example queries file:

----
# Name         	Query
#
selfapproved   	owner:self label:code-review+2,user=self
blocked        	label:code-review-2 OR label:verified-1
# Note below how to reference your own named queries in other named queries
ready          	label:code-review+2 label:verified+1 -query:blocked status:open
