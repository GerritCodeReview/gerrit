= Request Cancellation and Deadlines

[[motivation]]
== Motivation

Protect the Gerrit service by aborting requests that were cancelled or for which
the deadline has exceeded. If these requests are not aborted, it can happen that
too many of these requests are accumulated so that the server runs out of
resources (e.g. threads).

[[request-cancellation]]
== Request Cancellation

If a user cancels a request by disconnecting, ideally Gerrit should detect this
and abort the request execution to avoid doing unnecessary work. If nobody is
waiting for the response, Gerrit shouldn't spend resources to compute it.

Detecting cancelled requests is not easily possible with all protocols that a
client may use. At the moment Gerrit only detects request cancellations for git
pushes, but not for other request types (in particular cancelled requests are
not detected for REST calls over HTTP, SSH commands and git clone/fetch).

[[server-side-deadlines]]
== Server-side deadlines

To limit the maximal execution time for requests, administrators can [configure
server-side deadlines](config-gerrit.html#deadline.id). If a server-side
deadline is exceeded by a matching request, the request is automatically
aborted. In this case the client gets a proper error message informing the user
about the exceeded deadline.

Clients may override server-side deadlines by setting a
[deadline](#client-provided-deadline) on the request. This means, if a request
fails due to an exceeded server-side deadline, the client may repeat the request
with a higher deadline or no deadline (deadline = 0) to get unblocked.

Server-side deadlines are meant to protect the Gerrit service against resource
exhaustion due to performence issues with a particular request. E.g. imagine a
situation where requests for a certain REST endpoint are very slow. If more and
more of such requests get stuck and are not being aborted, the Gerrit service
may run out of threads, causing an outage for the entire Gerrit service.
Server-side deadlines may prevent this because the slow requests get aborted
after the deadline is exceeded, and hence the server resources are freed up.

In some cases server-side deadlines may also lead to a better user experience,
as it's better to tell the user that there is a performance issue, that prevents
the execution of the request, than letting them wait indefinitely.

Finally server-side deadlines can help ops engineers to detect performance
issues more reliably and more quicky. For this alerts may be setup that are
based on the [cancellation metrics](metrics.html#cancellations).

[[receive-timeout]]
=== Receive Timeout

For git pushes it is possible to configure a [hard
timeout](config-gerrit.html#receive.timeout). In contrast to server-side
deadlines, this timeout is not overridable by [client-provided
deadlines](#client-provided-deadlines).

[[client-provided-deadlines]]
== Client-provided deadlines

Clients can set a deadline on requests to limit the maximal execution time that
they are willing to wait for a response. If the request doesn't finish within
this deadline the request is aborted and the client receives an error, with a
message telling them that the deadline has been exceeded.

How to set a deadline on a request depends on the request type:

[options="header",cols="1,6"]
|=======================
|Request Type   |How to set a deadline?
|REST over HTTP |Set the [X-Gerrit-Deadline header](rest-api.html#deadline).
|SSH command    |Set the [deadline option](cmd-index.html#deadline).
|git push       |Set the [deadline push option](user-upload.html#deadline).
|git clone/fetch|Not supported.
|=======================

[[override-server-side-deadline]]
=== Override server-side deadline

By setting a deadline on a request it is possible to override any [server-side
deadline](#server-side-deadline), e.g. in order to increase it. Setting the
deadline to `0` disables any server-side deadline. This allows clients to get
unblocked if a request has previously failed due to an exceeded deadline.

[NOTE]
It is stronly discouraged for clients to permanently override [server-side
deadlines](#server-side-deadlines] with a higher deadline or to permanently
disable them by always setting the deadline to `0`. If this becomes necessary
the caller should get in touch with the Gerrit administrators to increase the
server-side deadlines or resolve the performance issue in another way.

[NOTE]
It's not possible for clients to override the [receive
timeout](#receive-timeout) that is enforced on git push.
