= Review UI

Reviewing changes is an important task and the Gerrit Web UI provides
many functionalities to make the review process comfortable and
efficient. This is a guide through the review UI that explains the
different functions and UI elements.

[[change-screen]]
== Change Screen

The change screen shows the details of a single change and provides
various actions on it.

[[commit-message]]
=== Commit Message Block

The focus of the change screen is on the commit message since this is
the most important information about a change. The numeric change ID
and the change status are displayed right above the commit message.

The commit message can be edited directly in the Web UI by clicking on
the `Edit Message` button in the change header. This opens a drop-down
editor box in which the commit message can be edited. Saving
modifications of the commit message automatically creates a new patch
set for the change. The commit message may only be edited on the
current patch set.

The numeric change ID is a link to the change and clicking on it
refreshes the change screen. By copying the link location you can get
the permalink of the change.

The change status shows the state of the change:

- `Needs <label>`:
+
The change is in review and an approval on the shown label is still
required to make the change submittable.

- `Not <label>`:
+
The change is in review and a veto vote on the shown label is
preventing the submit.

- `Not Current`:
+
The currently viewed patch set is outdated.
+
Please note that some operations, like voting, are not available on
outdated patch sets, but only on the current patch set.

- `Ready to Submit`:
+
The change has all necessary approvals and may be submitted.

- `Submitted, Merge Pending`:
+
The change was submitted and was added to the merge queue.
+
The change stays in the merge queue if it depends on a change that is
still in review. In this case it will get automatically merged when all
predecessor changes have been merged.
+
This status can also mean that the change depends on an abandoned
change or on an outdated patch set of another change. In this case you
may want to rebase the change.

- `Merged`:
+
The change was successfully merged into the destination branch.

- `Abandoned`:
+
The change was abandoned.

- `Draft`:
+
The change is a draft that is only visible to the change owner and the
reviewers.

[[commit-info]]
=== Commit Info Block

The commit info block shows information about the commit of the
currently viewed patch set.

It displays the author and the committer as links to a list of this
person's changes that have the same status as the currently viewed
change.

The commit ID and the link:user-changeid.html[Change-Id] are both
displayed with a copy-to-clipboard icon that allows the ID to be copied
into the clipboard.

If a Git web browser, such as GitWeb or Gitiles, is configured, there
is also a link to the commit in the Git web browser.
