= Gerrit Code Review - Reviewer States

[what-are-reviewer-states]
== What are the reviewer states?
Reviewer states describe the relationships you may have towards a Change
besides Change Owner. The reviewer state is an expression of expectation
and may also dictate the level of notification.

[[reviewer-state-cc]]
== CC
Being a CC means that this change may interest you and you (may) want to keep
track of its progress.

=== Automatic transitions
If you as a non-reviewer make a comment you are automatically added as CC to
the change.

=== Expectations/Intent
As a CC you aren't expected to, or do not currently intend to, take active part
in the review-process.

=== Dashboard
Changes for which you are CC show up in your dashboard under the "CCed on"
section.

[[reviewer-state-cc-plus-as]]
== CC + link:user-attention-set.html[Attention-set]
As a CC there are two reasons for why you may end up in the Attention-Set:

1. You made a comment and someone replied to that comment.
2. Someone manually added you to the Attention-Set.

=== Automatic transitions
If you make a comment and someone replies to that comment you are added to the
Attention-Set as a CC.

=== Expectations/Intent
Expectations and intent differs depending on how you were added to the
Attention-Set:

1. Someone replied to your comment:
+
You are expected to read the reply and respond if necessary.

2. Someone manually added you:
+
It is not clear what the expectations intent is in this case.

=== Dashboard
Changes for which you are CC and in the Attention-Set show up under the
"Your Turn" section of the dashboard.

[[reviewer-state-reviewer]]
== Reviewer
Being a Reviewer while not being in the Attention-Set means that you are an
active participant that is not currently expected to take action on the change.
* You may have posted a comment and are waiting for a reply.
* You may have already done what is required of you and, unless an action from
  you is once more requested, there's nothing more for you to do on the change.

=== Automatic transitions
If you, as a Reviewer in the Attention-Set, make a comment and/or vote on a
label you are automatically removed from the Attention-Set.

=== Expectations/Intent
There are currently no expectations on you.
However being a Reviewer shows others that you are a valuable stakeholder in
this particular change and that you should be notified (be put back into the
Attention-Set) if the situation changes or a question arises.

=== Dashboard
Changes for which you are Reviewer, but not in the Attention-Set, show up
under the "Incoming reviews" section of the dashboard.

[[reviewer-state-reviewer-plus-as]]
== Reviewer + link:user-attention-set.html[Attention-Set]
Being a Reviewer in the Attention-Set means that someone requires your action.
For more information about Attention-Set, see
link:user-attention-set.html[the Attention-Set documentation].

=== Automatic transitions
When you are added as a Reviewer you are automatically also added to the
Attention-Set. For an explanation about the other automatic transitions see
link:user-attention-set.html[the Attention-Set documentation].

=== Expectations/Intent
As a Reviewer in the Attention-Set the expectations are that you prioritize
taking action on the change.
If you aren't currently able to prioritize the change you should express this
by manually removing yourself from the Attention-Set while making a comment
that you don't have the possibility to act on it at the moment so that the
change owner may require action from other Reviewers or plan accordingly.

=== Dashboard
Changes for which you are CC and in the Attention-Set show up under the
"Your Turn" section of the dashboard.
