= Gerrit Code Review - Searching Accounts

== Basic Account Search

Similar to many popular search engines on the web, just enter some
text and let Gerrit figure out the meaning:

[options="header"]
|=============================================================
|Description                      | Examples
|Name                             | John
|Email address                    | jdoe@example.com
|Username                         | jdoe
|Account-Id                       | 1000096
|Own account                      | self
|=============================================================

[[search-operators]]
== Search Operators

Operators act as restrictions on the search. As more operators
are added to the same query string, they further restrict the
returned results. Search can also be performed by typing only a
text with no operator, which will match against a variety of fields.

[[cansee]]
cansee:'CHANGE'::
+
Matches accounts that can see the change 'CHANGE'. Can be enabled or
disabled by
link:config-gerrit.htmlgerrit#index.enableCanSeeQueries[index.enableCanSeeQueries].

[[email]]
email:'EMAIL'::
+
Matches accounts that have the email address 'EMAIL' or an email
address that starts with 'EMAIL'.

[[is]]
[[is-active]]
is:active::
+
Matches accounts that are active.

[[is-inactive]]
is:inactive::
+
Matches accounts that are inactive.

[[name]]
name:'NAME'::
+
Matches accounts that have any name part 'NAME'. The name parts consist
of any part of the full name and the email addresses.

[[username]]
username:'USERNAME'::
+
Matches accounts that have the username 'USERNAME'.

== Magical Operators

[[is-visible]]
is:visible::
+
Magical internal flag to prove the current user has access to read
the account. This flag is always added to any query.

[[is-active-magic]]
is:active::
+
Matches accounts that are active. If neither link:#is-active[is:active]
nor link:#is-inactive[is:inactive] is contained in a query, `is:active`
is automatically added so that by default only active accounts are
matched.

[[limit]]
limit:'CNT'::
+
Limit the returned results to no more than 'CNT' records. This is
automatically set to the page size configured in the current user's
preferences. Including it in a web query may lead to unpredictable
results with regards to pagination.
