= Gerrit Code Review - Searching Groups

Group queries only match internal groups. External groups and system
groups are not included in the query result.

[[search-operators]]
== Search Operators

Operators act as restrictions on the search. As more operators
are added to the same query string, they further restrict the
returned results.

[[inname]]
inname:'NAMEPART'::
+
Matches groups that have a name part that starts with 'NAMEPART'
(case-insensitive).

[[name]]
name:'NAME'::
+
Matches groups that have the name 'NAME' (case-insensitive).

[[uuid]]
uuid:'UUID'::
+
Matches groups that have the UUID 'UUID'.

== Magical Operators

[[is-visible]]
is:visible::
+
Magical internal flag to prove the current user has access to read
the group. This flag is always added to any query.

[[limit]]
limit:'CNT'::
+
Limit the returned results to no more than 'CNT' records. This is
automatically set to the page size configured in the current user's
preferences. Including it in a web query may lead to unpredictable
results with regards to pagination.
