= Gerrit Code Review - Searching Projects

[[search-operators]]
== Search Operators

Operators act as restrictions on the search. As more operators
are added to the same query string, they further restrict the
returned results.

[[name]]
name:'NAME'::
+
Matches projects that have exactly the name 'NAME'.

[[inname]]
inname:'NAME'::
+
Matches projects that a name part that starts with 'NAME' (case
insensitive).

[[description]]
description:'DESCRIPTION'::
+
Matches projects whose description contains 'DESCRIPTION', using a
full-text search.

[[state]]
state:'STATE'::
+
Matches project's state. Can be either 'active' or 'read-only'.

== Magical Operators

[[is-visible]]
is:visible::
+
Magical internal flag to prove the current user has access to read
the projects and all the refs. This flag is always added to any query.

[[limit]]
limit:'CNT'::
+
Limit the returned results to no more than 'CNT' records. This is
automatically set to the page size configured in the current user's
preferences. Including it in a web query may lead to unpredictable
results with regards to pagination.
