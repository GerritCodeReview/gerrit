= Gerrit Code Review - Searching Changes

== Default Searches

Most basic searches can be viewed by clicking on a link along the top
menu bar.  The link will prefill the search box with a common search
query, execute it, and present the results.

[options="header"]
|=======================================================
|Description                | Default Query
|Changes > Open             | status:open '(or is:open)'
|Changes > Merged           | status:merged
|Changes > Abandoned        | status:abandoned
|Your > Watched Changes     | is:watched is:open
|Your > Starred Changes     | is:starred
|Your > Draft Comments      | has:draft
|Your > Edits               | has:edit
|Your > All Visible Changes | is:visible
|Open changes in Foo        | status:open project:Foo
|=======================================================


== Basic Change Search

Similar to many popular search engines on the web, just enter some
text and let Gerrit figure out the meaning:

[options="header"]
|=============================================================
|Description                      | Examples
|Change Id                        | 15183
|Full or abbreviated Change-Id    | Ic0ff33
|Full or abbreviated commit SHA-1 | d81b32ef
|Email address                    | user@example.com
|=============================================================

For change searches (i.e. those using a change number, Change-Id, or commit
SHA-1), if the search results in a single change that change will be
presented instead of a list.

For more predictable results, use explicit search operators as described
in the following section.

[IMPORTANT]
--
The change search API is backed by a secondary index and might sometimes return
stale results if the re-indexing operation failed for a change update.

Please also note that changes are not re-indexed if the project configuration
is updated with newly added or modified
link:config-submit-requirements.html[submit requirements].

[[search-operators]]
== Search Operators

Operators act as restrictions on the search.  As more operators
are added to the same query string, they further restrict the
returned results. Search can also be performed by typing only a
text with no operator, which will match against a variety of fields.

Characters in operator values can be escaped by enclosing the value with
double quotes and escaping characters with a backslash. For example
`message:"This \"is\" fixing a bug"`.

[[age]]
age:'AGE'::
+
Amount of time that has expired since the change was last updated
with a review comment or new patch set.  The age must be specified
to include a unit suffix, for example `-age:2d`:
+
* s, sec, second, seconds
* m, min, minute, minutes
* h, hr, hour, hours
* d, day, days
* w, week, weeks (`1 week` is treated as `7 days`)
* mon, month, months (`1 month` is treated as `30 days`)
* y, year, years (`1 year` is treated as `365 days`)

`age` can be used both forward and backward looking: `age:2d`
means 'everything older than 2 days' while `-age:2d` means
'everything with an age of at most 2 days'.

[[attention]]
attention:'USER'::
+
Changes whose attention set includes the given user.

[[before_until]]
before:'TIME'/until:'TIME'::
+
Changes modified before the given 'TIME', inclusive. Must be in the
format `2006-01-02[ 15:04:05[.890][ -0700]]`; omitting the time defaults
to 00:00:00 and omitting the timezone defaults to UTC.

[[after_since]]
after:'TIME'/since:'TIME'::
+
Changes modified after the given 'TIME', inclusive. Must be in the
format `2006-01-02[ 15:04:05[.890][ -0700]]`; omitting the time defaults
to 00:00:00 and omitting the timezone defaults to UTC.

[[mergedbefore]]
mergedbefore:'TIME'::
+
Changes merged before the given 'TIME'. The matching behaviour is consistent
with `before:'TIME'`.

[[mergedafter]]
mergedafter:'TIME'::
+
Changes merged after the given 'TIME'. The matching behaviour is consistent
with `after:'TIME'`.

[[change]]
change:'ID'::
+
Either a change number such as 15183, or a Change-Id from the Change-Id footer.

[[conflicts]]
conflicts:'ID'::
+
Changes that conflict with change 'ID'. Change 'ID' can be specified
as a change number such as 15183, or a Change-Id from the Change-Id footer.

[[destination]]
destination:'[name=]NAME[,user=USER|,group=GROUP]'::
+
Changes which match the specified USER's or GROUP's destination named 'NAME'.
If 'USER' is unspecified, the current user is used. The named destinations can
be publicly accessible by other users.
The value may be wrapped in double quotes to include spaces. For example,
`destination:"myreviews,group=My Group"`
(see link:user-named-destinations.html[Named Destinations]).

[[owner]]
owner:'USER', o:'USER'::
+
Changes originally submitted by 'USER'. The special case of
`owner:self` will find changes owned by the caller.

[[ownerin]]
ownerin:'GROUP'::
+
Changes originally submitted by a user in 'GROUP'.

[[uploader]]
uploader:'USER'::
+
Changes where the latest patch set was uploaded by 'USER'.
The special case of `uploader:self` will find changes uploaded
by the caller.

+
Changes where the latest patch set was uploaded by a user in
'GROUP'.

[[query]]
query:'[name=]NAME[,user=USER]'::
+
Changes which match the specified USER's query named 'NAME'. If 'USER'
is unspecified, the current user is used. The named queries can be
publicly accessible by other users.
(see link:user-named-queries.html[Named Queries]).

[[reviewer]]
reviewer:'USER', r:'USER'::
+
Changes that have been, or need to be, reviewed by 'USER'. The
special case of `reviewer:self` will find changes where the caller
has been added as a reviewer.

[[cc]]
cc:'USER'::
+
Changes that have the given user CC'ed on them. The special case of `cc:self`
will find changes where the caller has been CC'ed.

[[commit]]
commit:'SHA-1'::
+
Changes where 'SHA-1' is one of the patch sets of the change.

[[project]]
project:'PROJECT', p:'PROJECT'::
+
Changes occurring in 'PROJECT'. If 'PROJECT' starts with `^` it
matches project names by regular expression.  The
link:http://www.brics.dk/automaton/[dk.brics.automaton
library,role=external,window=_blank] is used for evaluation of such patterns.

[[projects]]
projects:'PREFIX'::
+
Changes occurring in projects starting with 'PREFIX'.

[[parentof]]
parentof:'ID'::
Changes which are parent to the change specified by 'ID'. Change 'ID' can be
specified as a change number such as 15183, or a Change-Id from the 'Change-Id'
footer of the commit message. This operator will return immediate parents
and will not return grand parents or higher level ancestors of the given change.

[[parentproject]]
parentproject:'PROJECT'::
+
Changes occurring in 'PROJECT' or in one of the child projects of
'PROJECT'.

[[repository]]
repository:'REPOSITORY', repo:'REPOSITORY'::
+
Changes occurring in 'REPOSITORY'. If 'REPOSITORY' starts with `^` it
matches repository names by regular expression.  The
link:http://www.brics.dk/automaton/[dk.brics.automaton
library,role=external,window=_blank] is used for evaluation of such patterns.

[[repositories]]
repositories:'PREFIX', repos:'PREFIX'::
+
Changes occurring in repositories starting with 'PREFIX'.

[[parentrepository]]
parentrepository:'REPOSITORY', parentrepo:'REPOSITORY'::
+
Changes occurring in 'REPOSITORY' or in one of the child repositories of
'REPOSITORY'.

[[branch]]
branch:'BRANCH'::
+
Changes for 'BRANCH'.  The branch name is either the short name shown
in the web interface or the full name of the destination branch with
the traditional 'refs/heads/' prefix.
+
If 'BRANCH' starts with `^` it matches branch names by regular
expression patterns.  The
link:http://www.brics.dk/automaton/[dk.brics.automaton
library,role=external,window=_blank] is used for evaluation of such patterns.

[[intopic]]
intopic:'TOPIC'::
+
Changes whose designated topic contains 'TOPIC', using a full-text search.
+
If 'TOPIC' starts with `^` it matches topic names by regular
expression patterns.  The
link:http://www.brics.dk/automaton/[dk.brics.automaton
library,role=external,window=_blank] is used for evaluation of such patterns.

[[topic]]
topic:'TOPIC'::
+
Changes whose designated topic matches 'TOPIC' exactly.  This is
often combined with 'branch:' and 'project:' operators to select
all related changes in a series.

[[prefixtopic]]
prefixtopic:'TOPIC'::
+
Changes whose designated topic start with 'TOPIC'.

[[inhashtag]]
inhashtag:'HASHTAG'::
+
Changes where any hashtag contains 'HASHTAG', using a full-text search.
+
If 'HASHTAG' starts with `^` it matches hashtag names by regular
expression patterns.  The
link:http://www.brics.dk/automaton/[dk.brics.automaton
library,role=external,window=_blank] is used for evaluation of such patterns.

[[hashtag]]
hashtag:'HASHTAG'::
+
Changes whose link:intro-user.html#hashtags[hashtag] matches 'HASHTAG'.
The match is case-insensitive.

[[prefixhashtag]]
prefixhashtag:'HASHTAG'::
+
Changes whose link:intro-user.html#hashtags[hashtag] start with 'HASHTAG'.
The match is case-insensitive.

[[cherrypickof]]
cherrypickof:'CHANGE[,PATCHSET]'::
+
Changes which were created using the 'cherry-pick' functionality and
whose source change number matches 'CHANGE' and source patchset number
matches 'PATCHSET'. Note that 'PATCHSET' is optional. For example, a
`cherrypickof:12345` matches all changes which were cherry-picked from
change 12345 and `cherrypickof:12345,2` matches all changes which were
cherry-picked from the 2nd patchset of change 12345.

[[ref]]
ref:'REF'::
+
Changes where the destination branch is exactly the given 'REF'
name.  Since 'REF' is absolute from the top of the repository it
must start with 'refs/'.
+
If 'REF' starts with `^` it matches reference names by regular
expression patterns.  The
link:http://www.brics.dk/automaton/[dk.brics.automaton
library,role=external,window=_blank] is used for evaluation of such patterns.

[[tr,bug]]
tr:'ID', bug:'ID'::
+
Search for changes whose commit message contains 'ID' and matches
one or more of the
link:config-gerrit.html#trackingid[trackingid sections]
in the server's configuration file.  This is typically used to
search for changes that fix a bug or defect by the issue tracking
system's issue identifier.

[[label]]
label:'VALUE'::
+
Matches changes where the approval score 'VALUE' has been set during
a review.  See <<labels,labels>> below for more detail on the format
of the argument.

[[message]]
message:'MESSAGE'::
+
Changes that match 'MESSAGE' arbitrary string in the commit message body.
By default full text matching is used, but regular expressions can be
enabled by starting with `^`.
The link:http://www.brics.dk/automaton/[dk.brics.automaton library,role=external,window=_blank]
is used for the evaluation of such patterns. Note, that searching with
regular expressions is limited to the first 32766 bytes of the
commit message due to limitations in Lucene.

[[subject]]
subject:'SUBJECT'::
+
Changes that have a commit message where the first line (aka the subject)
matches 'SUBJECT'. The matching is done by full text search over the subject.

[[prefixsubject]]
prefixsubject:'PREFIX'::
+
Changes that have a commit message where the first line (aka the subject)
has the prefix 'PREFIX'.

[[comment]]
comment:'TEXT'::
+
Changes that match 'TEXT' string in any comment left by a reviewer.

[[path]]
path:'PATH'::
+
Matches any change touching file at 'PATH'. By default exact path
matching is used, but regular expressions can be enabled by starting
with `^`.  For example, to match all XML files use `file:"^.*\.xml$"`.
The link:http://www.brics.dk/automaton/[dk.brics.automaton library,role=external,window=_blank]
is used for the evaluation of such patterns.
+
Note that the Gerrit host may not support regular expression search.
You will then see an error dialog when using expressions starting with
`^`.
+
The `^` required at the beginning of the regular expression not only
denotes a regular expression, but it also has the usual meaning of
anchoring the match to the start of the string.  To match all Java
files, use `file:^.*\.java`.
+
The entire regular expression pattern, including the `^` character,
can be double quoted. For example, to match all XML
files named like 'name1.xml', 'name2.xml', and 'name3.xml' use
`file:"^name[1-3].xml"`.
+
Slash ('/') is used path separator.
+
*More examples:*

* `-path:^path/.*` - changes that do not modify files from `path/`.
* `path:{^~(path/.*)}` - changes that modify files not from `path/` (but may
contain files from `path/`).

[[file]]
file:'NAME', f:'NAME'::
+
Matches any change touching a file containing the path component
'NAME'.  For example a `file:src` will match changes that modify
files named `gerrit-server/src/main/java/Foo.java`. Name matching
is exact match, `file:Foo.java` finds any change touching a file
named exactly `Foo.java` and does not match `AbstractFoo.java`.
+
Regular expression matching can be enabled by starting the string
with `^`. In this mode `file:` is an alias of `path:` (see above).

[[extension]]
extension:'EXT', ext:'EXT'::
+
Matches any change touching a file with extension 'EXT', case-insensitive. The
extension is defined as the portion of the filename following the final `.`.
Files with no `.` in their name have no extension and can be matched by an
empty string.

[[onlyextensions]]
onlyextensions:'EXT_LIST', onlyexts:'EXT_LIST'::
+
Matches any change touching only files with extensions that are listed in
'EXT_LIST' (comma-separated list). The matching is done case-insensitive.
An extension is defined as the portion of the filename following the final `.`.
Files with no `.` in their name have no extension and can be matched by an
empty string.

[[directory]]
directory:'DIR', dir:'DIR'::
+
Matches any change where the current patch set touches a file in the directory
'DIR'. The matching is done case-insensitive. 'DIR' can be a full directory
name, a directory prefix or any combination of intermediate directory segments.
E.g. a change that touches a file in the directory 'a/b/c' matches for 'a/b/c',
'a', 'a/b', 'b', 'b/c' and 'c'.
+
Slash ('/') is used path separator. Leading and trailing slashes are allowed
but are not mandatory.
+
If 'DIR' starts with `^` it matches directories and directory segments by
regular expression. The link:http://www.brics.dk/automaton/[dk.brics.automaton
library,role=external,window=_blank] is used for evaluation of such patterns.

[[footer-operator]]
footer:'FOOTER'::
+
Matches any change that has 'FOOTER' as footer in the commit message of the
current patch set. 'FOOTER' can be specified verbatim ('<key>: <value>', must
be quoted) or as '<key>=<value>'. The matching is done case-insensitive.

[[hasfooter-operator]]
hasfooter:'FOOTERNAME'::
+
Matches any change that has a commit message with a footer where the footer
name is equal to 'FOOTERNAME'.The matching is done case-sensitive.

[[has]]
has:draft::
+
True if there is a draft comment saved by the current user.

[[has-star]]
has:star::
+
Same as 'is:starred', true if the change has been starred by the current user
with the default label.

has:edit::
+
True if the change has inline edit created by the current user.

has:unresolved::
+
True if the change has unresolved comments.

has:attention::
+
True if the change has attention by the current user.

Same as 'has:star', true if the change has been starred by the
current user with the default label.

is:attention::
+
True if the change has attention by the current user.

is:watched::
+
True if this change matches one of the current user's watch filters,
and thus is likely to notify the user when it updates.

is:reviewed::
+
True if any user has commented on the change more recently than the
last update (comment or patch set) from the change owner.

is:owner::
+
True on any change where the current user is the change owner.
Same as `owner:self`.

is:uploader::
+
True on any change where the current user is the uploader of
the latest patch set.
Same as `uploader:self`.

is:reviewer::
+
True on any change where the current user is a reviewer.

Same as `cc:self`.

is:open, is:pending, is:new::
+
True if the change is open.

is:closed::
+
True if the change is either merged or abandoned.

is:merged, is:abandoned::
+
Same as <<status,status:'STATE'>>.

[[is-submittable]]
is:submittable::
+
True if the change is submittable according to the submit rules for
the project, for example if all necessary labels have been voted on.
+
This operator only takes into account one change at a time, not any
related changes, and does not guarantee that the submit button will
appear for matching changes. To check whether a submit button appears,
use the
link:rest-api-changes.html#get-revision-actions[Get Revision Actions]
API.

[[mergeable]]
is:mergeable::
+
True if the change has no merge conflicts and could be merged into its
destination branch.
+
Mergeability of abandoned changes is not computed. This operator will
not find any abandoned but mergeable changes.
+
This operator only works if Gerrit indexes 'mergeable'. See
link:config-gerrit.html#change.mergeabilityComputationBehavior[change.mergeabilityComputationBehavior]
for details.

[[private]]
is:private::
+
True if the change is private, ie. only visible to owner and its
reviewers.

[[workInProgress]]
is:wip::
+
True if the change is Work In Progress.

[[merge]]
is:merge::
+
True if the change is a merge commit.

[[cherrypick]]
is:cherrypick::
+
True if the change is a cherrypick of an another change.

This is limited to changes which are cherrypicked using REST API
or WebUI only. It is not able to identify changes which are
cherry-picked locally using the git cherry-pick command and then
pushed to Gerrit.

[[pure-revert]]
is:pure-revert::
+
True if the change is a pure revert.

[[status]]
status:open, status:pending, status:new::
+
True if the change state is 'review in progress'.

Same as 'is:reviewed', matches if any user has commented on the change
more recently than the last update (comment or patch set) from the
change owner.

status:closed::
+
True if the change is either 'merged' or 'abandoned'.

status:merged::
+
Change has been merged into the branch.

status:abandoned::
+
Change has been abandoned.

[[size]]
added:'RELATION''LINES', deleted:'RELATION''LINES', delta/size:'RELATION''LINES'::
+
True if the number of lines added/deleted/changed satisfies the given relation
for the given number of lines.
+
For example, added:>50 will be true for any change which adds at least 50
lines.
+
Valid relations are >=, >, \<=, <, or no relation, which will match if the
number of lines is exactly equal.

[[commentby]]
commentby:'USER'::
+
Changes containing a top-level or inline comment by 'USER'. The special
case of `commentby:self` will find changes where the caller has
commented. Note that setting a vote is also considered as a comment.

[[from]]
from:'USER'::
+
Changes containing a top-level or inline comment by 'USER', or owned by
'USER'. Equivalent to `(owner:USER OR commentby:USER)`.

[[reviewedby]]
reviewedby:'USER'::
+
Changes where 'USER' has commented on the change more recently than the
last update (comment or patch set) from the change owner.

[[author]]
author:'AUTHOR', a:'AUTHOR'::
+
Changes where 'AUTHOR' is the author of the current patch set. 'AUTHOR' may be
the author's exact email address, or part of the name or email address. The
special case of `author:self` will find changes authored by the caller.

[[committer]]
committer:'COMMITTER'::
+
Changes where 'COMMITTER' is the committer of the current patch set.
'COMMITTER' may be the committer's exact email address, or part of the name or
email address. The special case of `committer:self` will find changes committed
by the caller.

[[rule]]
rule:'SUBMIT_RULE_NAME'::
+
Changes where 'SUBMIT_RULE_NAME' returns a submit record with status in {OK,
FORCED}. This means that the submit rule has passed and is not blocking the
change submission. 'SUBMIT_RULE_NAME' should be in the form of
'$plugin_name~$rule_name'. For gerrit core rules, 'SUBMIT_RULE_NAME' should
be in the form of 'gerrit~$rule_name' (example: `gerrit~DefaultSubmitRule`).

rule:'SUBMIT_RULE_NAME'='STATUS'::
+
Changes where 'SUBMIT_RULE_NAME' returns a submit record with status equals to
'STATUS'. The status can be any of the statuses that are documented for the
`status` field of link:rest-api-changes.html#submit-record[SubmitRecord].

[[unresolved]]
unresolved:'RELATION''NUMBER'::
+
True if the number of unresolved comments satisfies the given relation for the given number.
+
For example, unresolved:>0 will be true for any change which has at least one unresolved
comment while unresolved:0 will be true for any change which has all comments resolved.
+
Valid relations are >=, >, \<=, <, or no relation, which will match if the number of unresolved
comments is exactly equal.

== Argument Quoting

Operator values that are not bare words (roughly A-Z, a-z, 0-9, @,
hyphen, dot and underscore) must be quoted for the query parser.

Quoting is accepted as either double quotes
(e.g.  `message:"the value"`) or as matched
curly braces (e.g. `message:{the value}`).


== Boolean Operators

Unless otherwise specified, operators are joined using the `AND`
boolean operator, thereby restricting the search results.

Parentheses can be used to force a particular precedence on complex
operator expressions, otherwise OR has higher precedence than AND.

=== Negation
Any operator can be negated by prefixing it with `-`, for example
`-is:starred` is the exact opposite of `is:starred` and will
therefore return changes that are *not* starred by the current user.

The operator `NOT` (in all caps) or `not` (all lower case) is a
synonym.

=== AND
The boolean operator `AND` (in all caps) or `and` (all lower case)
can be used to join two other operators together.  This results in
a restriction of the results, returning only changes that match both
operators.

=== OR
The boolean operator `OR` (in all caps) or `or` (all lower case)
can be used to find changes that match either operator. This
increases the number of results that are returned, as more changes
are considered.


[[labels]]
== Labels
Label operators can be used to match approval scores given during
a code review.  The specific set of supported labels depends on
the server configuration, however the `Code-Review` label is provided
out of the box.

A label name is any of the following:

* The label name.  Example: `label:Code-Review`.

* The label name followed by a ',' followed by a reviewer id or a
  group id.  To make it clear whether a user or group is being looked
  for, precede the value by a user or group argument identifier
  ('user=' or 'group=').  If an LDAP group is being referenced make
  sure to use 'ldap/<groupname>'.

A label name must be followed by either a score with optional operator,
or a label status. The easiest way to explain this is by example.

First, some examples of scores with operators:

`label:Code-Review=2`::
`label:Code-Review=+2`::
`label:Code-Review+2`::
+
Matches changes where there is at least one +2 score for Code-Review.
The + prefix is optional for positive score values.  If the + is used,
the = operator is optional.

`label:Code-Review=-2`::
`label:Code-Review-2`::
+
Matches changes where there is at least one -2 score for Code-Review.
Because the negative sign is required, the = operator is optional.

`label:Code-Review=1`::
+
Matches changes where there is at least one +1 score for Code-Review.
Scores of +2 are not matched, even though they are higher.

`label:Code-Review>=1`::
+
Matches changes with either a +1, +2, or any higher score.
+
Instead of a numeric vote, you can provide a label status corresponding
to one of the fields in the
link:rest-api-changes.html#submit-record[SubmitRecord] REST API entity.

`label:Code-Review\<=-1`::
+
Matches changes with either a -1, -2, or any lower score.

`label:Code-Review=MAX`::
+
Matches changes with label voted with the highest possible score.

`label:Code-Review=MIN`::
+
Matches changes with label voted with the lowest possible score.

`label:Code-Review=ANY`::
+
Matches changes with label voted with any score.

`label:Code-Review=+1,count=2`::
+
Matches changes with exactly two +1 votes to the code-review label. The {MAX,
MIN, ANY} votes can also be used, for example `label:Code-Review=MAX,count=2` is
equivalent to `label:Code-Review=2,count=2` (if 2 is the maximum positive vote
for the code review label). The maximum supported value for `count` is 5.
`count=0` is not allowed and the query request will fail with `400 Bad Request`.

`label:Code-Review=+1,count>=2`::
+
Matches changes having two or more +1 votes to the code-review label. Can also
be used with the {MAX, MIN, ANY} label votes. All operators `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
are supported.
Note that a query like `label:Code-Review=+1,count<x` will not match with
changes having zero +1 votes to this label.

`label:Non-Author-Code-Review=need` (deprecated)::
+
Matches changes where the submit rules indicate that a label named
`Non-Author-Code-Review` is needed. (See the
link:prolog-cookbook.html#NonAuthorCodeReview[Prolog Cookbook] for how
this label can be configured.)
+
This operator is also compatible with
link:config-submit-requirements.html[submit requirement] results. A submit
requirement name could be used instead of the label name. The submit record
statuses are mapped to submit requirement result statuses as follows:
+
  * {`need`, `reject`} -> {`UNSATISFED`}
  * {`ok`, `may`} -> {`SATISFIED`, `OVERRIDDEN`}
+
For example, a query like `label:Code-Review=ok` will also match changes
having a submit requirement with a result that is either `SATISFIED` or
`OVERRIDDEN`. Users are encouraged not to rely on this operator since submit
records are deprecated.

`label:Code-Review=+2,aname`::
`label:Code-Review=ok,aname`::
+
Matches changes with a +2 code review where the reviewer or group is aname.

`label:Code-Review=2,user=jsmith`::
+
Matches changes with a +2 code review where the reviewer is jsmith.

`label:Code-Review=+2,user=owner`::
`label:Code-Review=ok,user=owner`::
`label:Code-Review=+2,owner`::
`label:Code-Review=ok,owner`::
+
The special "owner" parameter corresponds to the change owner.  Matches
all changes that have a +2 vote from the change owner.

`label:Code-Review=+2,user=non_uploader`::

== Magical Operators

Most of these operators exist to support features of Gerrit Code
Review, and are not meant to be accessed by the average end-user.
However, they are recognized by the query parser, and may prove
useful in limited contexts to administrators or power-users.

visibleto:'USER-or-GROUP'::
+
Matches changes that are visible to 'USER' or to anyone who is a
member of 'GROUP'.  Here group names may be specified as either
an internal group name, or if LDAP is being used, an external LDAP
group name.  The value may be wrapped in double quotes to include
spaces or other special characters.  For example, to match an LDAP
group: `visibleto:"CN=Developers, DC=example, DC=com"`.
+
This operator may be useful to test access control rules, however a
change can only be matched if both the current user and the supplied
user or group can see it.  This is due to the implicit 'is:visible'
clause that is always added by the server.

is:visible::
+
Magical internal flag to prove the current user has access to read
the change.  This flag is always added to any query.

[[limit]]
limit:'CNT'::
+
Limit the returned results to no more than 'CNT' records.  This is
automatically set to the page size configured in the current user's
preferences.  Including it in a web query may lead to unpredictable
results with regards to pagination.
