Gerrit Code Review - Superprojects subscribed to submodules updates
===================================================================

Description
-----------

When a commit is merged to a project, the commit content is scanned
to identify if it registers git submodules (if the commit contains
new gitlinks and .gitmodules file with required info) and if so,
a new submodule subscription is registered.

When a new commit of a registered submodule is merged, gerrit
automatically updates the subscribers to the submodule with new
commit having the updated gitlinks.

Git Submodules overview
-----------------------

It is a git feature that allows an external repository to be
attached inside one repository at a specific path. The objective here
is to provide a brief overview, further details can be found
in official git submodule command documentation.

Imagine a repository called 'super' and another one called 'a'.
Also consider 'a' available in a running gerrit instance on "server".
With this feature, one could attach 'a' inside of 'super' repository
in path 'a' by executing following command when inside 'super':
"git submodule add ssh://server/a a".

Still considering above example, after its execution notice inside
'super' local repository the 'a' folder is considered a gitlink
to external repository 'a'. Also notice a file called .gitmodules
is created (it is a config file containing the subscription of 'a').
The "git submodule status" command provides the sha-1 each gitlink
points to in the external repository.

In the example provided, if 'a' is updated and 'super' is supposed
to see latest sha-1 (considering here 'a' has only the master branch),
one should then commit 'a' modified gitlink in 'super' project.
Actually it would not need to be even an external update, one could
move to 'a' folder (insider 'super'), modify its content, commit,
then move back to 'super' and commit 'a' gitlink.

Creating a new subscription
---------------------------

Defining the submodule branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is required because Submodule subscription is actually the
subscription of a submodule project and one of its branches for
a branch of a super project.

Since it manages subscriptions in the branch scope, we could have
a scenario having a project called 'super' having a branch 'integration'
subscribed to a project called 'a' in branch 'integration', and also
having same 'super' project but in branch 'dev' subscribed to the 'a'
project in a branch called 'local-dev'.

After adding the git submodule to a super project, one should edit
the .gitmodules file to add revision field for each submodule
section supposed to be subscribed.

It is not automatically filled by git submodule command. Its value
should indicate the branch of submodule project that when updated
will trigger automatic update of its registered gitlink.

The revision value could be '.' if the submodule project branch
has the same name that the destination branch of commit having
gitlinks/.gitmodules file.

The revision field of a submodule section is a custom git submodule
feature for gerrit use. One should always certify to fill it by
editing .gitmodules file after adding submodules to a super project,
if it is the intention to make use of the gerrit feature introduced here.

Git submodules added and not having the revision field
available in .gitmodules file will not be subscribed by gerrit
to automatically update superproject.

Detecting and subscribing subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever a commit is merged to a project, its content is scanned
to identify if it registers submodules (if the commit contains new
gitlinks and .gitmodules file with all required info) and if so, a new
submodule subscription is registered.

Automatic update of superprojects
---------------------------------

After a submodule is subscribed to a superproject, it is not required
to push/merge commits of superproject to update the gitlink to submodule.

Whenever a commit is merged in submodule, its subscribed superproject
is updated.

Imagine a superproject called 'super' having a branch called 'dev'
having subscribed to a submodule 'a' on a branch 'dev-of-a'. When a commit
is merged in branch 'dev-of-a' of 'a' project, gerrit automatically
creates a new commit on branch 'dev' of 'super' updating the gitlink
to point to the just merged commit.

Canonical web url
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gerrit will automatically update only the superprojects that added
the submodules of urls of the running server (the one described in
canonical web url value in gerrit configuration file).

The Gerrit instance administrator group should always certify to
provide the canonical web url value in its configuration file. Users
should certify to use the url value of running gerrit instance to
add/subscribe submodules.

Removing subscriptions
----------------------

If one has added a submodule subscription and want to drop it, it is
required to merge a commit updating subscribed super project/branch
removing the gitlink and the submodule section of .gitmodules file.
