== Author workflow

You can apply one or more suggested fixes. When suggested fix is applied - it creates
a change edit that you can modify in gerrit. link:user-inline-edit.html#editing-change[More about editing mode.]

FYI: Publishing a new patchset in gerrit will make gerrit change out of sync with
your local git. You can checkout latest gerrit by using commands from download drop-down panel.

You can use copy to clipboard button to copy suggestion to clipboard and then you can paste it
in your editor.
