# Gerrit Code Review

[Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com) is a code review and project
management tool for Git based projects.

## Objective

Gerrit makes reviews easier by showing changes in a side-by-side display,
and allowing inline comments to be added by any reviewer.

Gerrit simplifies Git based project maintainership by permitting any
authorized user to submit changes to the master Git repository, rather
than requiring all approved changes to be merged in by hand by the project
maintainer.
