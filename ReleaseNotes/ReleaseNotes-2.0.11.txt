== Important Notes

=== Cache directory

Gerrit now prefers having a temporary directory to store a disk-based content cache.  This cache used to be in the PostgreSQL database, and was the primary reason for the rather large size of the Gerrit schema.  In 2.0.11 the cache has been moved to the local filesystem, and now has automatic expiration management to prevent it from growing too large.  As this is only a cache, making backups of this directory is not required.

It is suggested (but not required) that you enable this cache:
----
  mkdir $site_path/disk_cache
  chown gerrituser $site_path/disk_cache
  chmod 700 $site_path/disk_cache           ; # just to be paranoid
----
The directory can also be placed elsewhere in the local filesystem, see `cache.directory` in the `gerrit.config` file.

=== Protocol change

The protocol between the browser based JavaScript and the server has changed.  After installing 2.0.11 users need to load the site page again to ensure they are running 2.0.11 or later.  Users can verify they have the new version by checking the version number in the footer in the lower right.  Users who don't load the new version (e.g. are using a stale tab from a week ago) will see errors when trying to view patches.

== New Features

* GERRIT-8    Add 'Whole File' as a context preference in the user s...
* GERRIT-9    Honor user's "Default Context" preference
* GERRIT-14   Split patch view RPCs into two halves
* GERRIT-61   Database error in side by side view
* GERRIT-156  Rewrite the side-by-side and unified diff viewers
+
The side by side and unified patch viewers have been completely rewritten.  Gerrit now honors the user's Default Context setting (from My > Settings) in both the side by side and the unified patch view.  A new "Whole File" setting is also available, showing the complete file.

* GERRIT-154  Add the branch name to the beginning of the subject li...
* Sending mail when merge failed due to path conflict, m...
+
Some improvements have been made with regards to the emails sent by Gerrit.

* Configure the JGit WindowCache from $site_path/gerrit....
* Document the new gerrit.config file
+
Gerrit now supports a Git-style "$site_path/gerrit.config" configuration file.  Currently this supports configuration of the various memory caches, including control over JGit's pack file cache.  See the updated documentation section for more details:
link:http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/config-gerrit.html[http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/config-gerrit.html]

* Add "gerrit show-caches" to view cache statistics
+
There is a new administrative command over SSH called "gerrit show-caches" which displays current cache statistics for the various caches within the Gerrit memory space.

* Expand local part emails when creating new changes
+
Simple DWIMery: users can now do `repo upload --reviewer=who` to have the reviewer email automatically expand according to the email_format column in system_config, e.g. by expanding `who` to `who@example.com`.

== Bug Fixes

* GERRIT-81   Can't repack a repository while Gerrit is running
+
Running "git repack", "git gc" or "git fetch" in a repository owned by Gerrit is now safe while Gerrit is running.

* GERRIT-165  Don't create new user accounts as full name = "null nu...
+
New users coming from Google Accounts OpenID provider where given a full name of "null null" rather than "Anonymous Coward".

* Honor account.preferred_email when checking co...
+
Service users created by manually inserting into the accounts table didn't permit using their preferred_email in commits or tags; administrators had to also insert a dummy record into the account_external_ids table.  The dummy account_external_ids record is no longer necessary.
