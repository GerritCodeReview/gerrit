== Schema Change

None.  For a change.  :-)

== New Features
* Allow other ignore whitespace settings beyond IGNORE_S...
+
Now you can ignore whitespace inside the middle of a line, in addition to on the ends.

== Bug Fixes
* Update SSHD to include SSHD-28 (deadlock on close) bug...
+
Fixes a major stability problem with the internal SSHD.  Without this patch the daemon can become unresponsive, requiring a complete JVM restart to recover the daemon.  The symptom is connections appear to work sporadically... some connections are fine while others freeze during setup, or during data transfer.

* Fix line-wrapped To/CC email headers
+
Long To/CC headers with multiple recipients sometimes ran together, making Reply-to-all in the user's email client not address them correctly.  This was a bug in the header formatting code, it wasn't RFC 2822 compliant.

* GERRIT-227  Fix server error when remaining hunks are comments
* Fix binary search in SparseFileContent
+
Stupid bugs in the patch viewing code.  Random server errors and/or client UI crashes.
