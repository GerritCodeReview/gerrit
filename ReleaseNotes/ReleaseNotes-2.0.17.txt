== New Features
* Add '[' and ']' shortcuts to PatchScreen.
+
The keys '[' and ']' can be used to navigate to previous and next file in a patch set.

* GERRIT-241  Always show History panel in PatchScreen
+
The History panel in a patch screen is now always shown, even if there is only one patch set for this file.  This permits viewing the number of comments more easily when navigating through files with ']'.

* Add 'Reply' button to comments on diff screen
+
There is now a 'Reply' button on the last comment, making it easier to create a new comment to reply to a prior comment on the same line.  However, Gerrit still does not quote the prior comment when you reply to it.

* GERRIT-228  Apply syntax highlighting when showing file content
+
Files are now syntax highlighted.  The following languages are supported, keyed from common file extensions:  C (and friends), Java, Python, Bash, SQL, HTML, XML, CSS, JavaScript, and Makefiles.

* GERRIT-139  Allow mimetype.NAME.safe to enable viewing files
+
The new configuration option mimetype.NAME.safe can be set to enable unzipped download of a file, for example a Microsoft Word document.  See http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/config-gerrit.html for examples.

* GERRIT-179  Display images inline for compare if mimetype.image/*....
+
If mimetype.image/TYPE.safe is true images can be viewed inline in order to more easily visually compare them when an image is modified.  Primarily useful for viewing icons in an icon library.

* File review status tracking.
+
Per-user green check marks now appear when you view a file.  This makes it easier to keep track of which patch set you last looked at, and within a patch set, which files you have looked at, and which ones you have not.

* GERRIT-247  Allow multiple groups to own a project
+
The owner of a project was moved from the General tab to the Access Rights tab, under a new category called Owner.  This permits multiple groups to be designated the Owner of the project (simply grant Owner status to each group).

== Bug Fixes
* Permit author Signed-off-by to be optional
+
If a project requires Signed-off-by tags to appear the author tag is now optional, only the committer/uploader must provide a Signed-off-by tag.

* GERRIT-197  Move 'f' and 'u' navigation to PatchScreen
+
The 'f' and 'u' keystrokes in a patch screen were disabled when there were no differences to view.  This was fixed, they are now always available.

* Remove annoying 'no differences' error dialog
* GERRIT-248  Fix server crash when showing no difference
+
The "No Differences" error dialog has been removed.  Instead the "No Differences" message is displayed in the patch screen.  This makes navigation through a pair of patch sets easier with ']' (no dialog stopping to interrupt you when you encounter a file that has not changed and has no comments).

* GERRIT-244  Always enable Save button on comment editors
+
Some WebKit based browsers (Apple Safari, Google Chrome) didn't always enable the Save button when selecting a word and deleting it from a comment editor.  This is a bug in the browser, it doesn't send an event to the Gerrit UI.  As a workaround the Save button is now just always enabled.

* GERRIT-206  Permit showing changes to gitlinks (aka submodule poin...
+
You can now view a change made to a gitlink (aka a submodule path).

* GERRIT-171  Don't crash the submit queue when a change is a criss-...
+
Instead of crashing on a criss-cross merge case, Gerrit unsubmits the change and attaches a message, like it does when it encounters a path conflict.
