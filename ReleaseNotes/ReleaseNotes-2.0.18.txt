Important Notices
-----------------

Please ensure you read the following important notices about this release; .18 is a much larger release than usual.

* OpenID Configuration
+
If you use OpenID authentication, the `trusted_external_ids`
table has moved from the database to the local gerrit.config
file.  Please ensure you copy any critical patterns to the
`auth.trustedOpenID` setting in gerrit.config before upgrading
your server.  Failure to set a pattern will allow Gerrit
to trust any OpenID provider.  Refer to `auth.trustedOpenID` in
[http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/config-gerrit.html Configuration] for more details.

* Caches
+
The groups that a user is a member of is no longer stored in the 
`groups` cache; it is now part of the `accounts` cache.  If you
use a cron script to update the `account_groups` database table
based upon an external data source (such as LDAP), you will need  
to adjust your script to flush the `accounts` cache.
The `diff` cache is no longer written to disk by default.  
To enable the disk store again, administrators must explicitly
set `cache.directory` in the gerrit.config file prior to starting
Gerrit.

* SSH Usernames
+
SSH usernames are no longer automatically assigned to the 
local part of the user's email address.  With 2.0.18, usernames
must also be unique within the database.  These changes were
implemented to resolve a minor potential security issue with
the SSH authentication system.  More details can be found in the
[http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=tools/gerrit.git;a=commit;h=080b40f7bbe00ac5fc6f2b10a861b63ce63e8add commit message].

Schema Change
-------------

*WARNING: This version contains a schema change* (since 2.0.17)

Important notes about this schema change:

* The schema change may be difficult to undo once applied.
+
Downgrading could be very difficult once the upgrade has been started.
Going back to 2.0.17 may not be possible.

* Do not run the schema change while the server is running.
+
This upgrade changes the primary keys of several tables, an operation
which shouldn't occur while end-users are able to make modifications to
the database.  I _strongly_ suggest a full shutdown, schema upgrade,
then startup approach for this release.
Apply the database specific schema script:
----
  java -jar gerrit.war --cat sql/upgrade015_016_part1_postgres.sql | psql reviewdb
  java -jar gerrit.war --cat sql/upgrade015_016_part1_mysql.sql    | mysql reviewdb
----

After the upgrade is successful, apply the final script to drop dead tables:
----
  java -jar gerrit.war --cat sql/upgrade015_016_part2.sql | psql reviewdb
  java -jar gerrit.war --cat sql/upgrade015_016_part2.sql | mysql reviewdb
----

New Bugs
--------
* Memory leaks during warm restarts

2.0.18 includes [http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/ Google Guice], which leaves a finalizer thread dangling when the Gerrit web application is halted by the servlet container.  As this thread does not terminate, the web context stays loaded in memory indefinitely, creating a memory leak.  Cold restarting the container in order to restart Gerrit is highly recommended.


New Features
------------
* GERRIT-104  Allow end-users to select their own SSH username
+
End users may now select their own SSH username through the web interface.  The username must be unique within a Gerrit server installation.  During upgrades from 2.0.17 duplicate users are resolved by giving the username to the user who most recently logged in under it; other users will need to login through the web interface and select a unique username.  This change was necessary to fix a very minor security bug (see above).

* Display supported commands when subcommand is not prov...
+
Running `ssh -p 29418 gerrit.example.com gerrit` now lists the complete set of subcommands recognized by the gerrit top level command.  This (slightly) improves discoverability of the remote command execution facilities.

* Add a Register link in the menu bar when not signed in
+
The Register link in the top right shows up on OpenID based sites when the user is not yet signed in.  This should help discoverability of signing into a Gerrit server to establish your account identity.

* Combine all initial page data into a single object
* Avoid XSRF initialization requests by using one token ...
+
An initial XSRF token is now sent as part of the initial HTTP request, and used for all subsequent RPCs from that browser.  This reduces the initial page load time by cutting out a few round trips that previously were used to bootstrap that XSRF token.

* Redirect /Gerrit#foo to /#foo on the client side
+
Gerrit now favors "/#mine" rather than "/Gerrit#mine" for URLs.  Older style URLs will be redirected to the newer style automatically, for the foreseeable future.

* Sort permissions in project access tab
* Get branches directly from Git rather than database
* Style tab panel headers like our menu bar header
* Narrow tables that don't have to be 100% width
* Cleanup display of external ids in the user settings
+
A few minor UI nits in the Settings and Admin panels.  The new UI is a bit more consistent with the theme, and formats data in a bit more sane way.  Nothing earth shattering.

* Make disk cache completely optional
+
As noted above in the section about cache changes, the disk cache is now completely optional.

Bug Fixes
---------
* GERRIT-5    Remove PatchSetInfo from database and get it always fr...
+
A very, very old bug.  We no longer mirror the commit data into the SQL database, but instead pull it directly from Git when needed.  Removing duplicated data simplifies the data store model, something that is important as we shift from an SQL database to a Git backed database.

* GERRIT-220  Fix infinite loop in PatchScriptBuilder
+
Under somewhat rare conditions web request threads locked up in an infinite loop while obtaining the data necessary to show a side-by-side or unified patch view to a browser.  The loop doesn't allocate any memory, or perform any database requests, but it still ties up a database connection and a servlet container request processing thread indefinitely.  We found the bug internally at Google when our Gerrit server load average spiked to 32... and we had no more connections in our database connection pool, which was also sized at a max of 32 handles.

* Fix Reviewed-On lines to only include the server URL o...
+
The Reviewed-On lines in cherry-picked commits were duplicating the server URL.

* Set outgoing email header Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8...
+
Emails are sent in UTF-8, which may have the high bit set.  Thus the transfer encoding must always be set as 8bit, to prevent gateways from potentially discarding the high bits and corrupting the UTF-8 message payload.

* Ensure OpenID related responses aren't cached by proxi...
+
Some OpenID related login responses may have sent HTTP headers which were confusing to proxies, potentially allowing a proxy to cache something it should not have cached.  The headers were clarified to better denote no caching is permitted.

* Move ChangeApproval to be a child of PatchSet
+
The database schema changed, adding `patch_set_id` to the approval object, and renaming the approval table to `patch_set_approvals`.  If you have external code writing to this table, uh, sorry, its broken with this release, you'll have to update that code first.  :-\

Other Changes
-------------
