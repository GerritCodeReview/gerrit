== Important Notes

Starting with this version, Gerrit is now packaged as a single WAR file.
Just download and drop into your webapps directory for easier deployment.
The WAR file itself is also executable via "java -jar gerrit.war", so tools
like CreateSchema are easier to invoke ("java -jar gerrit.war
CreateSchema").

The following optional 3rd party JARs are not included in the WAR:

* Bouncy Castle Crypto API
* H2 JDBC Driver
* c3p0 pooled DataSource
+
Existing Gerrit administrators either need to change the SSH host key used
by their servers, or download the Bouncy Castle Crypto API.  The OpenSSH key
file format can only be read if Bouncy Castle is available, so you need to
install that library to continue using an existing host key.  If you are
using Jetty, you can download the library (
http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html) to $JETTY_HOME/lib/plus, then restart
Jetty.
If you use H2 as your database, you will need to download the JDBC driver
and insert it into your container's CLASSPATH.  But I think all known
instances are on PostgreSQL, so this is probably not a concern to anyone.
