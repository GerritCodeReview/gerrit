== New Features

* Adding support to list merged and abandoned changes
+
The project link in a change now lists all changes merged in that
project, or abandoned in that project, based upon the state of the
change the link is displayed in.  So open changes link to all open
changes in the same project while merged changes link to all merged
changes in the same project.  These links are bookmarkable.

== Bug Fixes

* Fix new change email to always have SSH pull URL
* Move git pull URL to bottom of email notifications

The new change emails were missing the SSH pull URL, fixed.  Also
the SSH pull URL is now further away from the web URL, to make it
