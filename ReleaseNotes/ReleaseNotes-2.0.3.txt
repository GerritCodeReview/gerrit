I would like to express a big thank you to Brad Larson for diving into
Gerrit and coming up with the implementation for  "Add reviewer to an
existing change".  This has been an open issue in the bug tracker for a
while, and its finally closed thanks to his work.

== New Features

* GERRIT-37  Add additional reviewers to an existing change
* Display old and new image line numbers in unified diff
* Make 'c', 'r' in a patch view open a new comment editor
* Allow up/down arrow keys to scroll the page in patch view
* Use a Java applet to help users load public SSH keys

== Bug Fixes

* GERRIT-72  Make review comments standout more from the surrounding text
* GERRIT-7   Restart the merge queue when Gerrit starts up
* Fix message threading for comment replies
* Fix unified diff view to support creating a comment
* Fix line numbers for new post-image comments in unified diff
* Don't store SSH keys we know to be invalid
* Bust out of an iframe if Gerrit is embedded in one
+
The last item is a security fix.  It prevents Gerrit from being loaded
inside of an iframe, which is a potential security flaw if some evil outer
page used CSS tricks to show only a portion of a particular part of the
Gerrit UI.  Such a display might be able to convince a user they are
clicking on one thing, while doing something else entirely.
