= Release notes for Gerrit 2.0.4

Gerrit 2.0.4 is now available in the usual location:

*WARNING: This version contains a schema change.*

Simple version of the schema upgrade:

  java -jar gerrit.war --cat sql/upgrade004_005_part1.sql | psql reviewdb

If you aren't collecting the contact information fields on individual
user accounts (the accounts columns contact_address, contact_country,
contact_phone_nbr, contact_fax_nbr) then you can safely apply both the
part1 and part2 upgrades without further thought.

  java -jar gerrit.war --cat sql/upgrade004_005_part2.sql | psql reviewdb

After this upgrade, the contact fields under My > Settings > Contact
Information will be hidden.

A much longer upgrade process is explained in the documentation if you
need to store the contact data.

This horribly painful change was necessary to better protect
individual user's privacy by strongly encrypting their contact
information, and storing it "off site".
