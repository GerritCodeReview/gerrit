*WARNING: This version contains a schema change.*

Schema upgrade:

  java -jar gerrit.war --cat sql/upgrade006_007.sql | psql reviewdb

This version has some major bug fixes for JGit.  I strongly encourage people to upgrade, we had a number of JGit bugs identified last week, all of them should be fixed in this release.


== New Features
