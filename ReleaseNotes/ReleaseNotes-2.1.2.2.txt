Bug Fixes
---------

* Add ',' to be encoded in email headers.
+
Email headers which used UTF-8 character set encoding did not
properly escape a comma.  Fixed.

* issue 513 Log OpenID SSL failures
+
If OpenID authentication fails, such as due to the JRE not having
access to any of the root certificates and therefore being unable
to open an https connection, the problem is now logged to the
server's error_log.
