Bug Fixes
---------

* issue 528 gsql: Fix escaping of quotes in JSON
+
JSON output was not properly escaped, due to a bug in the underlying
Gson library.  Fixed by upgrading.

* issue 531 commit-msg: Fix jumbling of URL at end of message
+
URLs at the end of a commit message sometimes caused the Change-Id
to be inserted above the URL, rather than below it.  Fixed, but
users will need to recopy the hook to their local repositories.

* Don't allow OWN to be inherited from All Projects
+
The project Owner permission was accidentally inherited from the
magical All Projects in certain cases.  This was not meant to happen,
ownership cannot be inherited down.  Fortunately we didn't permit
the Owner permission to be added to All Projects, so this was not
likely to have occurred in real installations.

* Traverse all LDAP groups that a user is member of
* Expand LDAP groups only if accountMemberField set
+
Fixes traversal of groups on an Active Directory server, ensuring
that the user's grandparent groups are available to Gerrit as part
of their user session.

* Define a toString for PatchListKey to improve errors
+
Minor bug fix to improve the level of detail that is available when
the server is unable to difference two patch sets on demand for a
user request.
