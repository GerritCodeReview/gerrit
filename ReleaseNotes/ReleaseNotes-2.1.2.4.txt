New Features
------------

* Add 'checkout' download command to patch sets
+
The Download area of a patch set now offers a command line to fetch
and checkout the patch set on a detached HEAD.  This is more suitable
for building and testing the change locally.

Bug Fixes
---------

* issue 545 Fallback to ISO-8859-1 if charset isn't supported
+
Some input files are misrecognized by the jchardet library that is
used to automatically guess a character set.  A guessed charset
might not even be supported by the local JRE.  In such cases the
ISO-8859-1 character set is used as a fallback, so the file content
is still visible.

* Update JGit to 0.7.1.34-gf36df5d to fix empty tree bug
+
Repositories which contained an empty tree object (very uncommon, its
technically a bug to produce a repository like this) wouldn't clone
properly from the embedded Gerrit SSH or HTTP daemon.  Fixed upstream
in JGit 0.7.0, but we never picked up the bug fix release.

Documentation Corrections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* documentation: Elaborate on branch level Owner
+
Documentation didn't describe that the Owner permission within a
project can be used to delegate control over a branch namespace to
another group.

* documentation: Document Read Access +2 aka Upload Access
+
The documentation didn't describe what Read +2 means.
