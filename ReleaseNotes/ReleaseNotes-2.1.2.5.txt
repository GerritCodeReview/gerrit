Bug Fixes
---------

* issue 390 Resolve objects going missing
+
Clients disconnecting from the SSH server sometimes caused an
interrupt to be delivered to their corresponding server work thread.
That interrupt delivered at the wrong time caused a file to be
closed unexpectedly, resulting in JGit marking the file as invalid
and thereby losing access to its contents.  Fixed by serializing
access to the file.

* ps: Fix implementation to alias to gerrit show-queue
+
The SSH command `ps` was meant to be an alias for `gerrit show-queue`
but due to a copy-and-paste error was actually an alias for a
different command.  Fixed.
