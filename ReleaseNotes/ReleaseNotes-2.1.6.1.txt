== Schema Change

If upgrading from 2.1.6, there are no schema changes.  Replace the
WAR and restart the daemon.

If upgrading from 2.1.5 or earlier, there are schema changes.
To upgrade:
----
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
----

== New Features
* Display the originator of each access rule
+
The project access panel now shows which project each rule inherits
from.  This can be informative when the inheritance chain is more
than 1 project deep (for example C inherits from B, which inherits
from A, which inherits from \-- All Projects \--).

* Improved user->gerrit push speed
+
Pushing changes for review (or directly to a branch) should be
quicker now, especially if the project contains many changes.

* Allow Owner permission to inherit
+
The project Owner permission can now be inherited from any parent
project, provided that the parent project is not the root level
\-- All Projects \--.

== Bug Fixes
* Fix disabled intraline difference checkbox
+
Intraline difference couldn't be enabled once it was disabled by
a user in their user preferences.  Fixed.

* Fix push over HTTP
+
Users couldn't push to Gerrit over http://, due to a bug in the
way user authentication was handled for the request.  Fixed.

* issue 751 Update displayed owner group after group rename
+
The group owner field didn't update when a group was self-owned,
and the self-owned group was renamed.  This left the owner name
at the old name, leaving the user to wonder if the group owner was
also reassigned by another user.  Fixed.

* init: Fix string out of bounds when importing projects
+
Project importing died when the top level directory contained a
".git" directory (usually by accident by the site administrator).
Fixed.
