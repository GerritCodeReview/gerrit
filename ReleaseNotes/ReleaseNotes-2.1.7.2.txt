== Bug Fixes
* issue 997 Resolve Project Owners when checking access rights
+
Members of the 'Project Owners' magical group did not always have
their project owner privileges when Gerrit Code Review was looking
for "access to any ref" at the project level. This was caused by
not expanding the 'Project Owner's group to the actual ownership
list. Fixed.

* issue 999 Do not reset Patch History selection on navigation
+
Navigating to the next/previous file lost the setting of the
"Old Version" made under the "Patch History" expandable control
on a specific file view. This was accidentally broken when the
"Old Version History" control was added to the change page. Fixed.

* Fix API breakage on ChangeDetailService
+
Version 2.1.7 broke the Gerrit Code Review plugin for Mylyn Reviews
due to an accidental signature change of one of the remote JSON
APIs. The ChangeDetailService.patchSetDetail() method is back to the
old signature and a new patchSetDetail2() method has been added to
handle the newer calling convention used in some contexts of the
web UI.
