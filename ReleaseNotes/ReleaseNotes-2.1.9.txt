Bug Fixes
---------
* Patch JGit security hole
+
The security hole may permit a modified Git client to gain access
to hidden or deleted branches if the user has read permission on
at least one branch in the repository. Access requires knowing a
SHA-1 to request, which may be discovered out-of-band from an issue
tracker or gitweb instance.
