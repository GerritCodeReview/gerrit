should set the new `ldap.fetchMemberOfEagerly` option to `false`.

== OAuth

* Expose extension point for generic OAuth providers.

== OpenID

* Add support for Launchpad on the login form.

* Remove pre-configured Google OpenID 2.0 provider from the login form, that is
going to be shut down on 20, April 2015.
