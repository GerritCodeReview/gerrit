== Important Notes

*WARNING:* There are no schema changes from
link:ReleaseNotes-2.10.2.html[2.10.2], but Bouncycastle was upgraded to 1.51.
It is therefore important to upgrade the site with the `init` program, rather
than only copying the .war file over the existing one.

*WARNING:* When upgrading from version 2.8.4 or older with a site that uses
Bouncy Castle Crypto, new versions of the libraries will be downloaded. The old
libraries should be manually removed from site's `lib` folder to prevent the
startup failure described in
link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3084[Issue 3084].

It is recommended to run the `init` program in interactive mode. Warnings will
be suppressed in batch mode.

== New Features

* Support hybrid OpenID and OAuth2 authentication
+
OpenID auth scheme is aware of optional OAuth2 plugin-based authentication.
This feature is considered to be experimental and hasn't reached full feature set yet.
Particularly, linking of user identities across protocol boundaries and even from
one OAuth2 identity to another OAuth2 identity wasn't implemented yet.

=== Configuration

* Allow to configure
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.10.3/config-gerrit.html#sshd.rekeyBytesLimit[
SSHD rekey parameters].

== SSH

* Update SSHD to 0.14.0.
+
This fixes link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-348[SSHD-348] which
was causing ssh threads allocated to stream-events clients to get stuck.
+
Also update SSHD Mina to 2.0.8 and Bouncycastle to 1.51.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2797[Issue 2797]:
Add support for ECDSA based public key authentication.

== Bug Fixes

* Prevent wrong content type for CSS files.
+
The mime-util library contains two content type mappings for .css files:
`application/x-pointplus` and `text/css`.  Unfortunately, using the wrong one
will result in most browsers discarding the file as a CSS file.  Ensure we only
use the correct type for CSS files.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3289[Issue 3289]:
Prevent NullPointerException in Gitweb servlet.

=== Replication plugin

* Set connection timeout to 120 seconds for SSH remote operations.
+
The creation of a missing Git, before starting replication, is a blocking
operation. By setting a timeout, we ensure the operation does not get stuck
forever, essentially blocking all future remote git creation operations.

=== OAuth extension point

* Respect servlet context path in URL for login token
+
On sites with non empty context path, first redirect was broken and ended up
with 404 Not found.

* Invalidate OAuth session after web_sessions cache expiration
+
After web session cache expiration there is no way to re-sign-in into Gerrit.

=== Daemon

* Print proper names for tasks in output of `show-queue` command.
+
Some tasks were not displayed with the proper name.

=== Web UI

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3044[Issue 3044]:
Remove stripping `#` in login redirect.

=== SSH

* Prevent double authentication for the same public key.


== Performance

* Improved performance when creating a new branch on a repository with a large
number of changes.


== Upgrades

* Update Bouncycastle to 1.51.

* Update SSHD to 0.14.0.
