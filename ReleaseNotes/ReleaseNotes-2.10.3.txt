SSH

Add support for ECDSA based public key authentication.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Prevent wrong content type for CSS files.
+
The mime-util library contains two content type mappings for .css files:
`application/x-pointplus` and `text/css`.  Unfortunately, using the wrong one
will result in most browsers discarding the file as a CSS file.  Ensure we only
use the correct type for CSS files.

OAuth extension point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Respect servlet context path in URL for login token
+
On sites with non empty context path, first redirect was broken and ended up
with 404 Not found.

* Invalidate OAuth session after web_sessions cache expiration
+
After web session cache expiration there is no way to re-sign-in into Gerrit.

Daemon
~~~~~~

* Print proper names for tasks in output of `show-queue` command.
+
Some tasks were not displayed with the proper name.

Web UI
~~~~~~

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3044[Issue 3044]:
Remove stripping `#` in login redirect.

SSH
~~~

* Prevent double authentication for the same public key.

* Update SSHD to 0.14.0.
