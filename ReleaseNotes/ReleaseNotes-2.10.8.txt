Bug Fixes
---------

* [Issue 10262](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10262) Update JGit to 4.5.5.201812240535-r
+
This JGit fix validation of wants in git-upload-pack for protocol v0 stateless transports.
AdvertiseRefsHook was not called for git-upload-pack in protocol v0 stateless transports,
meaning that wants were not validated and a user could fetch anything that is pointed to
by any ref (using fetch-by-sha1), as long as they could guess the object name.
