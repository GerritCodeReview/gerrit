== Important Notes


*WARNING:* This release contains schema changes.  To upgrade:
----
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
----

*WARNING:* When upgrading from an existing site that was initialized with Gerrit
version 2.6 to version 2.9.1, the primary key column order will be updated for
some tables. It is therefore important to upgrade the site with the `init` program,
rather than only copying the .war file over the existing one.

It is recommended to run the `init` program in interactive mode. Warnings will
be suppressed in batch mode.

*WARNING:* Upgrading to 2.10.x requires the server be first upgraded to 2.8
(or 2.9) and then to 2.10.x. If you are upgrading from 2.8.x or
later, you may ignore this warning and upgrade directly to 2.10.x.

*WARNING:* The `auth.allowGoogleAccountUpgrade` setting is no longer supported.

*WARNING:* When upgrading from version 2.8.4 or older with a site that uses
Bouncy Castle Crypto, new versions of the libraries will be downloaded. The old
libraries should be manually removed from site's `lib` folder to prevent the
startup failure described in
link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3084[Issue 3084].

periodic garbage collection of all projects].

* Remove `auth.allowGoogleAccountUpgrade` setting.
+
It's been more than 5 years since Gerrit ran on Google AppEngine.  It is assumed
that everyone has upgraded their installations to a modern 2.x based server, and
will not need to have this upgrade path enabled.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2618[Issue 2618]:

=== Plugins

* Support for externally loaded plugins.
+
Plugins can be implemented in Scala or Groovy using the
link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/\#/admin/projects/plugins/scripting/groovy-provider[
Groovy provider] and
link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/plugins/scripting/scala-provider[
Scala provider] plugins.

* Allow plugins to replace the WebSession implementation.
+
Plugins can replace the existing implementation with the statement:
`DynamicItem.bind(binder(), WebSession.class).to(...);`
in a module designated as a `<Gerrit-HttpModule>` in the manifest.
+
Just the Cache implementation used for web sessions can be changed
by binding to a subclass of the now abstract `CacheBasedWebSession`
which supplies the Cache in the superclass constructor.
+
This is a step towards solving web session issues with multi-master.
+
The link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/plugins/websession-flatfile[
websession-flatfile plugin] replaces the built-in Gerrit WebSession implementation
with one that uses a flat file based cache.

* Allow http and ssh plugins to replace the Gerrit-provided DynamicItem.

* New extension point to listen to usage data published events.
+
Plugins implementing the `UsageDataPublishedListener` can listen to
events published about usage data.

* New extension point to link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.10/dev-plugins.html#pre-upload-hook[
register JGit PreUploadHook].
+
Plugins may register PreUploadHook instances in order to get
notified when JGit is about to upload a pack. This may be useful
for those plugins which would like to monitor usage in Git
repositories.

* New link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.10/config-validation.html#pre-upload-validation[
pre-upload validation extension point].
+
Plugins implementing the `UploadValidationListener` interface can
perform additional validation checks before any upload operations
(clone, fetch, pull). The validation is executed right before Gerrit
begins to send a pack back to the git client.

* New link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.10/dev-plugins.html#links-to-external-tools[
external tool links extension points].
+
Plugins can now contribute project links that will be displayed on the project
list screen in the 'Repository Browser' column, and revision links that will be
shown on the change screen.

* Allow creation of persistent caches after server is started.
+
This enables plugins to create own persistent caches when they are
installed.

* Make gerrit's HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse visible to http
plugins.

* New extensions in the Java Plugin API:

** Query changes
** Create/get/list projects
** Get/set review status
** Create change
** Get account
** Star/unstar changes
** Check if revision needs rebase

== Bug Fixes

=== General

* Use fixed rate instead of fixed delay for log file compression.
+
Log file compression was scheduled using a fixed delay. This caused the start
times to drift over time. Use a fixed rate instead so that the compression
reoccurs at the same time every day.

* Don't email project watchers on new draft changes.
+
If a draft change is created by pushing to `refs/drafts/master`, only the reviewers
explicitly named on the command line (which may be empty) should be notified of
the change. Users watching the project should not be notified, as the change has
not yet been published.

* Fix resource exhaustion due to unclosed LDAP connection.
+
When `auth.type` is set to `LDAP` (not `LDAP_BIND`), two LDAP connections are
made, but one was not being closed. This eventually caused resource exhaustion
and LDAP authentications failed.

=== Access Permissions

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2995[Issue 2995]:
Fix faulty behaviour in `BLOCK` permission.
+
`BLOCK` can be overruled with `ALLOW` on the same project, however there was a
bug when a child of the above project duplicates the `ALLOW` permission. In this
case the `BLOCK` would always win for the child, even though the `BLOCK` was
overruled in the parent.

=== Web UI

==== General

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2595[Issue 2595]:
Make gitweb redirect to login.
+
Gitweb redirects to the login page if the user isn't currently logged.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2631[Issue 2631]:
Re-arrange info at footer of Gerrit web UI pages.
+
Move the Gerrit info link so that there are no links close to the next page link.

* Only create All-Projects ACL once.
+
If `refs/meta/config` already existed it was overwritten with default configuration
if a site administrator ran `java -war gerrit.war init -d /some/existing/site --batch`.


==== Change Screen

* Don't linkify trailing dot or comma in messages.
+
As linkifying trailing dots and trailing commas does more harm than
good, we only treat dots and commas as being part of urls, if they are
neither followed by whitespace nor occur at the end of a string.

* Re-enable the 'Cherry Pick' button after canceling the dialog.
+
If the dialog was canceled, the button remained disabled and could not be
used again.

* Improve message when removing a reviewer.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=527[Issue 527]:
Preserve line breaks in inline and review comments.

* Always show 'No Score' as label help for zero votings.

* Only reset the edited commit message text on cancel.

* Only include message on quick approve if reply is open.

* List reviewers with dummy approvals on closed changes.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2890[Issue 2890]:
Enable scrollbars for "Edit Commit Message" TextArea.

* Use current time instead of submitter time for cherry-picked commits.
+
Cherry picking with the submitter time could cause massive clock skew
in the Git commit graph if the server was shutdown before the submit could
finish, and restarted hours later.

* Fix exception when clicking on a binary file without being signed in.


==== Side-By-Side Diff

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2970[Issue 2970]:
Fix misalignment of side A and side B for long insertion/deletion blocks.

* Give B side full width when A side is hidden.

* Fix scroll alignment when showing hidden A side.

* Bind Shift-N to search-prev in vim mode.

* Allow text selection in diff header.

* Display diff header on mode changes and renames.

* Document Shift-{Left,Right} in `?` help popup.

* Show `[` and `]` shortcut keys in nav arrow tooltips.

* Disable "Render = Slow" mode on files over 4000 lines.

* Keep keyboard bindings alive after click in padding.

* Jump to the first change on either side.

* Expand margin between paragraphs in comments.

* Include content on identical files with mode change.


==== User Settings

* Avoid loading all SSH keys when adding a new one.


=== Secondary Index / Search


* Omit corrupt changes from search results.

* Allow illegal label names from default search predicate.

=== REST

==== General

* Fix REST API responses for 3xx and 4xx classes.

==== Changes

* Fix inconsistent behaviour in the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.10/rest-api-changes.html#add-reviewer[
add reviewer endpoint]
+
When adding a single reviewer to a change, it was possible to use the endpoint
to add a user who had no visibility to the change or whose account was invalid.


==== Changes

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2583[Issue 2583]:
Reject inline comments on files that do not exist in the patch set.

* Allow forcing mergeability check on
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.10/rest-api-changes.html#get-mergeable[
Get mergeable].

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2622[Issue 2622]:
Respect patch set visibility for messages.
+
Messages retrieval didn't check for patch set visbility and thus messages for
draft patch sets were returned back to the client.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2782[Issue 2782]:
Add missing documentation of the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.10/rest-api-changes.html#get-related-changes[
Get Related Changes] endpoint.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2723[Issue 2723]:
Clarify the response info in the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.10/rest-api-changes.html#get-change-detail[
Get Change Detail] endpoint.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2693[Issue 2693]:
Clarify the response info in the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.10/rest-api-changes.html#list-comments[
List Comments] endpoint.

=== SSH


* Prevent double authentication for the same public key.
+
This is a workaround for link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-300[
SSHD-300].

* Let `kill` SSH command only kill tasks that are visible to the caller.

* Require 'Administrate Server' capability to see server summary output from
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.10/cmd-show-caches.html[
`show-caches`] command.

* Include all command arguments in SSH log entry.
+
The SSH log only included the first argument. This prevented the repository name
from being logged when `git receive-pack` was executed instead of `git-receive-pack`.


=== Daemon


* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2284[Issue 2284]:
More detailed error message when failing to upload new change.
+
When the uploaded change cannot be created on the underlying Git repository, a
more descriptive error message is displayed on both client and server side. This
allows to troubleshoot internal errors (e.g. JGit lock failures or other causes)
and help out in the resolution.

* Enforce HTTP password checking on gitBasicAuth.

* Fix missing commit messages on submodule direct pushes.
+
The commit message in superproject was missing on submodule's
directly pushed changes.


=== Plugins

==== General


* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2895[Issue 2895]:
Fix reload of plugins that use DynamicItem.

* Invoke `StartPluginListener` and `ReloadPluginListener` only after start/reload
is fully done.

* Set `Last-Modified` on cached Documentation resources.

* Return HTTP 304 for not modified SmallResources.
