+
A change introduced in version 2.11 caused the `%base` option to not work
any more, meaning it was not possible to push a commit, which is already merged
into a branch, for review to another branch of the same project.

* link:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=468024[JGit bug 468024]:
Fix data loss if a pack is pushed to a JGit based server and gc runs
concurrently on the same repository.

+
The results of REST API calls were incorrectly being converted from NativeString
to String when called from Javascript.

Include prettify source files in the documentation.
+
The prettify source files were being loaded from `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, which
may cause trouble if the Gerrit instance is behind a firewall on a machine not
allowed to access the Internet at large.
+
Now those files are bundled with the documentation.

* Print proper name for reindex after update tasks in `show-queue` command.
