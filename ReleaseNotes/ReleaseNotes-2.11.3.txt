Bug Fixes
---------

* Do not suggest inactive accounts.
+
When, for example, adding accounts to a group the drop down list would also
suggest inactive accounts.
+
Inactive accounts are now excluded from the suggestion.

* Fix markdown rendering for the Gitiles plugin.
+
The Gitiles project uses the grappa library which causes a class collision with
parboiled which was used by Gerrit. This resulted in markdown files not being
rendered by the Gitiles plugin.


Updates
-------

* Update Guice to 4.0.
* Replace parboiled 1.1.7 with grappa 1.0.4.
