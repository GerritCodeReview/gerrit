Bug Fixes
---------

* Do not suggest inactive accounts.
+
When, for example, adding accounts to a group the drop down list would also
suggest inactive accounts.
+
Inactive accounts are now excluded from the suggestion.

* Fix performance of side-by-side diff screen for huge files.
+
The `Render=Slow` preference was not being disabled for huge files, resulting
in poor performance on most browsers.

* Prefer JavaScript clipboard API if available.
+
Modern versions of Chrome support a draft clipboard API from JavaScript that
allows copying without use of a Flash widget. If the API appears to be available
in the browser, it is now used instead of the Flash widget.

* Fix markdown rendering for the Gitiles plugin.
+
The Gitiles project uses the grappa library which causes a class collision with
parboiled which was used by Gerrit. This resulted in markdown files not being
rendered by the Gitiles plugin.


Updates
-------

* Update Guice to 4.0.
* Replace parboiled 1.1.7 with grappa 1.0.4.
