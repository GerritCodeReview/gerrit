== Bug Fixes

* Do not suggest inactive accounts.
+
When, for example, adding accounts to a group, the drop down list would also
suggest inactive accounts.
+
Inactive accounts are now excluded from the suggestion.

* Fix performance of side-by-side diff screen for huge files.
+
The `Render=Slow` preference was not being disabled for huge files, resulting
in poor performance on most browsers.

* Prefer JavaScript clipboard API if available.
+
Modern versions of Chrome support a draft clipboard API from JavaScript that
allows copying without use of a Flash widget. If the API appears to be available
in the browser, it is now used instead of the Flash widget.

* Fix markdown rendering for the Gitiles plugin.
+
The Gitiles project uses the grappa library which causes a class collision with
parboiled which was used by Gerrit. This resulted in markdown files not being
rendered by the Gitiles plugin.

* Fix submodule subscription for nested projects.
+
If the project name was 'a/b', and a project named 'b' also existed, the
subscription would be incorrectly set on project 'b'.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3478[Issue 3478]:
Show correct status line for draft patch sets.
+
If a new patch set was uploaded as draft to an existing published change,
the status line did not reflect the draft status of the now current patch
set.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3477[Issue 3477]:
Fix client error when current patch set is not visible to user.
+
If the latest patch set of a change was a draft that was not visible to the
logged in user, clicking on the side by side diff link caused a javascript error
on the client.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3468[Issue 3468]:
Include URL to change in "change closed" error message.
+
Instead of only the change number, the error message now includes the URL to
the change.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3366[Issue 3366]:
Call `NewProjectCreatedListeners` after project creation is complete.
+
The listeners were being called before all project details had been created
and recorded.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3505[Issue 3505]:
Add "Uploaded patch set 1" message for changes created via the UI.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3504[Issue 3504]:
Prevent users from publishing change edits if they have not signed the CLA.
+
It was possible for users who had not signed the Contribution License Agreement
(CLA) to publish change edits on projects that require a CLA.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2209[Issue 2209]:
Honor username provided by container.

* Stop logging unknown group membership for null UUID.
Null UUIDs are now skipped rather than spamming the log.
+
UUIDs which have no registered backends are still logged. These may be errors
caused by plugins not loading that an admin should pay attention to and try to
resolve.

== Updates

* Update Guice to 4.0.
* Replace parboiled 1.1.7 with grappa 1.0.4.
