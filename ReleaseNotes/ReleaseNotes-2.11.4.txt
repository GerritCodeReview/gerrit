Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix NullPointerException in `ls-project` command with `--has-acl-for` option.
+
Using the `--has-acl-for` option for external groups (e.g. LDAP groups) was
causing a NullPointerException.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3328[Issue 3328]:
Allow to push a tag that points to a non-commit object.
+
When pushing a tag that points to a non-commit object, like
link:https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/tag/?id=v2.6.11[
`v2.6.11` on linux-stable] which points to a tree, or
link:https://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/tag/?id=spearce-gpg-pub[
`spearce-gpg-pub` on jgit] which points to a blob, Gerrit rejected the push with
the error message 'missing object(s)'.
+
Note: This was previously fixed in Gerrit version 2.11.1, but was inadvertently
reverted in 2.11.2 and 2.11.3.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=28178[Issue 2817]:
Insert Change-Id into access right changes.
+
When modifications of access rights were saved for review, the change
did not have a Change-Id in the commit message.

* Fix duplicated log lines after reloading a plugin.
+
If a plugin was reloaded, logs emitted from the plugin were duplicated.

* Remove `--recheck-mergeable` option from `reindex` command documentation.
+
The `--recheck-mergeable` option was removed in Gerrit version 2.11.

* Use the correct validation policy for commits created by Gerrit.
+
Commits created by Gerrit were being validated in the same way as commits
received from users.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3557[Issue 3557]:
Disallow invalid reference patterns in project configuration.
+
When editing a project configuration by using the UI or by submitting a change
to `refs/meta/config`, it was possible to add a permission to an invalid
reference pattern. This caused the project to be unavailable and the `ls-projects`
command to fail whenever this project was encountered.
