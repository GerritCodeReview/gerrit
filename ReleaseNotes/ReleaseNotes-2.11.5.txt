Bug Fixes
---------

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3442[Issue 3442]:
Handle commit validation errors when creating/editing changes via REST.
+
When an exception was thrown by a commit validator during creation of
a new change, or during publish of an inline edit, this resulted in an
internal server error message which did not include the actual reason
for the error.

* Prevent usage of not initialized `IndexCollection`.
+
There was a slight window of opportunity that `IndexCollection` could be
used without being fully initialized, leading to a `QueryParseException`.
+
Such a situation could happen when a commit to `refs/meta/config` was done
from a plugin's `LifecycleListener.start()` method.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3616[Issue 3616]:
Strip trailing blank lines from commit messages when modified in the inline
editor.
+
Blank lines were not trimmed from the end of commit messages, when caused
problems when the commit was merged and then cherry-picked with the `-x`
option (from the command line).

* Tweak JS clipboard API integration to work on Firefox.
+
The JS 'copy' functionality was working on Chrome, but not on Firefox.

* Include server config module in init step.
+
This allows SecureStore to be used during plugins' init step.
