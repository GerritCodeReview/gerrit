== Important Notes

*WARNING:* This release uses a forked version of buck.

Buck was forked to cherry-pick an upstream fix for building on Mac OSX
El Capitan.

To build this release from source, the Google repository must be added to
the remotes in the buck checkout:

----
 $ git remote add google https://gerrit.googlesource.com/buck

== Bug Fixes

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3442[Issue 3442]:
Handle commit validation errors when creating/editing changes via REST.
+
When an exception was thrown by a commit validator during creation of
a new change, or during publish of an inline edit, this resulted in an
internal server error message which did not include the actual reason
for the error.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3616[Issue 3616]:
Strip trailing blank lines from commit messages when modified in the inline
editor.
+
Blank lines were not trimmed from the end of commit messages, which caused
problems when the commit was merged and then cherry-picked with the `-x`
option (from the command line).

* Tweak JS clipboard API integration to work on Firefox.
+
The JS 'copy' functionality was working on Chrome, but not on Firefox.

* Use image instead of unicode character for copy button.
+
Some browsers were unable to render the unicode character.

* Include server config module in init step.
+
This allows SecureStore to be used during plugins' init step.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3659[Issue 3659]:
Show inline comments in change screen history when inline edit is active.
+
It was not possible to see the inline comments in the history on the
change screen when in edit mode.

* Improve rendering of `stream-events` tasks in the `show-queue` output.
+
Entries for `stream-events` are now rendered as 'Stream Events (username)'.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3655[Issue 3655]:
Fix incorrect owner group matching behavior.
+
When the given group did not match any group, the group was matched
on a group whose name starts with the argument, instead of throwing an
error to notify the user.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3664[Issue 3664]:
Fix double slash on URL when switching account.
+
One too many slashes on the URL caused redirection back to the root
page instead of the intended location.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3666[Issue 3666]:
Fix server error when commit validator is invoked on initial commit.
+
If a commit was uploaded for review as the first commit in a repository
that was created with no initial empty commit, invoking a commit validator
on the new commit would cause an internal error.

* Replication plugin.

** Parse replication delay and retry times as time units.
+
The replication delay and retry values were interpreted as seconds and
minutes respectively, but were being parsed as integers.
+
This is inconsistent with how time units are handled in other Gerrit
configuration settings, and can cause confusion when the user configures
them using the time unit syntax such as '15s' and it causes the plugin
to fail with 'invalid value'.
+
The delay and retry now are parsed as time units. The value can be given
in any recognized time unit, and the defaults remain the same as before;
15 seconds and 1 minute respectively.

** Remove documentation of obsolete `remote.NAME.timeout` setting.
