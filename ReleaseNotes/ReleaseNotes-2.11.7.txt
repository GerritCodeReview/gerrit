== Bug Fixes

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3882[Issue 3882]:
Fix 'No user on email thread' exception when label with group parameter is
used in watched projects predicate.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3877[Issue 3877]:
Include files in output when using `gerrit query` with combination of
search operators.
+
A regression introduced in version 2.11.6 caused files to be omitted
in the output.

* Include comments in output when using `gerrit query` with the
`--current-patch-set` option.
+
Comments were added at the change level but were not added at the
patch set level.

* Honor the `sendemail.allowrcpt` setting when adding new email address.
+
When adding a new email address via the UI or REST API, it was possible for
the user to add an address that does not belong to a domain allowed by the
`sendemail.allowrcpt` configuration. However, when sending the verification
email, the recipient address was (correctly) dropped, and the email had no
recipients. This resulted in an error from the SMTP server and an 'Internal
server error' message to the user.

* Remove unnecessary log messages.
+
The messages 'Assuming empty group membership' and 'Skipping delivery of
email' do not add any value and were filling up the error log.
