remote code execution exploit].

Fix keyboard shortcuts for non-US keyboards on side-by-side diff screen.
+
The forward/backward navigation keys `[` and `]` only worked on keyboards where
these characters could be typed without using any modifier key (like CTRL, ALT,
etc.).

Note that the problem still exists on the unified diff screen.

Explicitly set parent project to 'All-Projects' when a project is created
without giving the parent.

* Don't add message twice on abandon or restore via ssh review command.
+
When abandoning or reviewing a change via the ssh `review` command, and
providing a message with the `--message` option, the message was added to
the change twice.

* Clear the input box after cancelling add reviewer action.
+
When the action was cancelled, the content of the input box was still
there when opening it again.

* Fix internal server error when aborting ssh command.
