Bug Fixes
---------

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4055[Issue 4055]:
Fix subject for 'Updated Changes' lines on push.
+
When a change was updated it showed the subject from the previous patch set
instead of the subject from the new current patch set

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4070[Issue 4070]:
Don't return current patch set in queries if the current patch set is not
visible.
+
When querying changes with the `gerrit query` ssh command, and passing the
`--current-patch-set` option, the current patch set was included even when
it is not visible to the caller (for example when the patch set is a draft,
and the caller cannot see drafts).

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3970[Issue 3970]:
Fix keyboard shortcuts for special processing of CTRL and META.
+
The processing of CTRL and META was incorrectly removed in Gerrit version
2.11.8, resulting in shortcuts like 'STRG+T' being interpreted as 'T'.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4056[Issue 4056]:
Fix download URLs for BouncyCastle libraries.
+
The location of the libraries was moved, so the download URLs are updated
accordingly.

* Fix incorrect loading of access sections in `project.config` files.

* Fix internal server error when `auth.userNameToLowerCase` is enabled
and the auth backend does not provide the username.

* Fix error reindexing changes when a change no longer exists.

* Fix internal server error when loading submit rules.

* Fix internal server error when parsing tracking footers from commit
messages.
