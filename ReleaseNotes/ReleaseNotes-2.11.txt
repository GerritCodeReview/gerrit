modify the site's `ChangeSubject.vm` template to use `$change.originalSubject` to
improve threading for GMail inboxes.
+
The `originalSubject` field is automatically taken from the existing subject
field during first use.


Plugins
~~~~~~~

General
^^^^^^^

* Plugins can listen to account group membership changes
+
The audit log service allows to register listeners to group member added and
group member deleted events. A default listener logs these events to the database
as before, but additional listeners may now be registered for these events using
the `GroupMemberAuditListener` interface.

* Plugins can validate ref operations.
+
Plugins implementing the `RefOperationValidationListener` interface can
perform additional validation checks against ref creation/deletion operations
before they are applied to the git repository.

* Plugins can provide project-aware top menu extensions
+
Plugins can provide sub-menu items within the 'Projects' context. The
'${projectName}' placeholder is replaced by the project name.

* Auto register static/init.js as JavaScript plugin.
+
When a plugin does not expose Guice Modules explicitly, auto discover and
register static/init.js as WebUi extension if found by the plugin content
scanner.

* Plugins can validate outgoing emails.
+
Plugins implementing `OutgoingEmailValidationListener` interface can filter
and modify outgoing emails before they are sent.

* Plugins that provide initialization steps may now use functionality
from InitUtil in core Gerrit.

* New extensions in the Java Plugin API:

** Set/Put topic.
** Get mergeable status.
** link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=461[Issue 461]:
Get current user.
** Get file content.
** Get file diff.
** Get comments and drafts.

Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Projects can be specified with wildcard in the `start` command.


Bug Fixes
---------

Daemon
~~~~~~

* Change 'Merge topic' to 'Merge changes from topic'.
+
When multiple changes from a topic are submitted resulting in a merge commit,
the title of the merge commit is now 'Merge changes from topic' instead of
'Merge topic'.

* Fix visibility checks for `refs/meta/config`.
+
Under some conditions it was possible for the `refs/meta/config` branch to be
erroneously considered not visible to the user.

* Sort list of updated changes in output from push.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2940[Issue 2940]:
Improve warning messages when Change-Id is missing in the commit message.

** Add a hint to amend the commit after installing the commit-msg hook.
** Don't show 'Suggestion for commit message' when Change-Id is missing.


Secondary Index / Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2822[Issue 2822]:
Improve Lucene analysis of words linked with '_' or '.'.
+
Instead of treating words linked with '_' or '.' as one word, Lucene now
treats them as separate words.

* Fix support for change~branch~id in query syntax.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[remove-generate-http-password-capability]]
* Remove the 'Generate HTTP Password' capability.
+
The 'Generate HTTP Password' capability has been removed to close a security
vulnerability.  Now only administrators are allowed to generate and delete other
users' http passwords via the REST or SSH interface.
+
It is encouraged to clean up your `project.config` settings after upgrading.


Web UI
~~~~~~

Change Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2894[Issue 2894]:
Link to change screen for merged or abandoned changes in the 'Related Changes'
list.
+
For changes in the 'Related Changes' tab that are closed the link was
bringing the user to GitWeb, and not as expected to the change screen.

* Show a confirmation dialog before deleting a draft change or patch set.
+
Previously there was no confirmation and a draft change or revision patch
set would be lost if the button was accidentally clicked.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2533[Issue 2533]:
Improve the layout and color scheme of buttons.
+
Several improvements have been made:
+
** Move 'Publish' and 'Delete Change/Revision' buttons into header.
+
If a change/revision is a draft the natural next step is to publish (or delete)
it, hence these buttons should be displayed in a more prominent place.

** Highlight the 'Publish' button in blue.
+
If a change is a draft the natural next step is to publish it, hence
the 'Publish' button should be highlighted similar to the quick
approve button.

** Fix the border color of buttons on the reply popup.
+
The buttons are blue but had white borders, which was inconsistent with the
buttons on the change screen.

** Remove red color for 'Abandon' and 'Restore' buttons.
+
There is nothing dangerous about these operations that justifies
highlighting the buttons in red color. When the buttons are clicked
there is a popup where the user must confirm the operation, so it can
still be canceled.

** Hide quick approve button for draft changes.
+
A draft change cannot be submitted, hence quick approving it is not that
important. Hiding the quick approve button on draft changes makes space in the
header for displaying more important actions such as 'Publish'.

* Differentiate between conflicts and already merged errors in cherry-pick
+
When a cherry-pick operation failed with 'Cherry pick failed' error, there was no
way to know the reason for the failure: merge conflict or the commit is already
on the target branch.  These failures are now differentiated and a proper error
is reported to the client.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2837[Issue 2837]:
Improve display of long user names for collapsed comments in history.
+
If there were several users with long user names with the same prefix, e.g.
'AutomaticGerritVoterLinux' and 'AutomaticGerritVoterWindows', they would both
be shown as 'AutomaticGerritVo...' and users had to expand the comment to see
the full user name.
+
The ellipsis is now inserted in the middle of the user name so that the start
and end of the user name are always visible, e.g. 'AutomaticG...VoterLinux' and
'AutomaticG...terWindows'.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2992[Issue 2992]:
Fix display of review comments for Chrome on Android.
+
Chrome for Android has Font Boosting, which caused the review comments to
be displayed too large.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2909[Issue 2909]:
Make change owner votes removable.
+
If a change owner voted on a change, it was not possible for anyone other
than the owner to remove the vote.

* Preserve topic when cherry-picking.
+
When a change is cherry-picked, the topic from the source change is preserved
on the newly created change.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3007[Issue 3007]:
Make the selected tab persistent.
+
If a change from the 'Same Topic' tab was clicked, the selected tab would reset
to the default tab ('Related Changes').


Side-By-Side Diff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Return to normal mode after editing a draft comment.
+
Previously it would remain in visual mode.


Project Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix alignment of checkboxes on project access screen.
+
The 'Exclusive' checkbox was not aligned with the other checkboxes.

REST API
~~~~~~~~

Changes
^^^^^^^

* Remove the administrator restriction on the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/rest-api-changes.html#index-change[
index change] endpoint.
+
The endpoint can now be used by any user who has visibility of the change.

* Only include account ID in responses unless `DETAILED_ACCOUNTS` option is set.
+
The behavior was inconsistent with the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/rest-api-accounts.html#account-info[
documentation]. In the default case it was including only the account name,
rather than only the account ID.

* Include revision's ref in responses.
+
The ref of a revision was only returned as part of the fetch info, which is only
available if the download commands are installed.

* Correctly set the limit to the default when no limit is given in the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/rest-api-changes.html#suggest-reviewers[
suggest reviewers] endpoint.

Projects
^^^^^^^^

* Make it mandatory to specify at least one of the `--prefix`, `--match` or `--regex`
options in the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/rest-api-projects.html#list-projects[
list projects] endpoint.
