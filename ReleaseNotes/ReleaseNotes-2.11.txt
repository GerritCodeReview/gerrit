Release Highlights
------------------


* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=505[Issue 505]:
Changes can be created and edited directly in the browser. See the
link:#inline-editing[Inline editing] section for more details.


Experimental Features
---------------------

The following new features are experimental. They are not fully documented yet,
and it is not recommended to enable them in live production systems.

* Migration of review information from database to git notes.
+
Groundwork has been done to implement migration of review information from the
database to a git notes based backend.
+
Existing review information can be migrated from the review database to
git notes with the `RebuildNotedb` program.
+
This feature can be enabled with the following settings in `gerrit.config`:
----
[gerrit]
  notedbpath = notedb
[notedb "changes"]
  write = true
  read = true
----

* Hashtags.
+
Hashtags can be added to changes. The hashtags are stored in git notes and
are indexed in the secondary index.
+
This feature requires the notedb to be enabled.


New Features
------------


Web UI

Inline Editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that the inline editing feature only works with the new change screen.

screen.

to CodeMirror for editing.

* Edit mode can be started from the side-by-side diff screen with seamless
navigation to CodeMirror.

the `All-Users` repository rather than in the database.

Plugins
~~~~~~~

General
^^^^^^^

* Plugins can listen to account group membership changes
+
The audit log service allows to register listeners to group member added and
group member deleted events. A default listener logs these events to the database
as before, but additional listeners may now be registered for these events using
the `GroupMemberAuditListener` interface.

* Plugins can validate ref operations.
+
Plugins implementing the `RefOperationValidationListener` interface can
perform additional validation checks against ref creation/deletion operations
before they are applied to the git repository.

* Plugins can provide project-aware top menu extensions
+
Plugins can provide sub-menu items within the 'Projects' context. The
'${projectName}' placeholder is replaced by the project name.

* Auto register static/init.js as JavaScript plugin.
+
When a plugin does not expose Guice Modules explicitly, auto discover and
register static/init.js as WebUi extension if found by the plugin content
scanner.

* Plugins that provide initialization steps may now use functionality
from InitUtil in core Gerrit.

* New extensions in the Java Plugin API:

** Set/Put topic.
** Get mergeable status.
** link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=461[Issue 461]:
Get current user.

Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Projects can be specified with wildcard in the `start` command.


Bug Fixes
---------

Daemon
~~~~~~

* Change "Merge topic" to "Merge changes from topic".
+
When multiple changes from a topic are submitted resulting in a merge commit,
the title of the merge commit is now "Merge changes from topic" instead of
"Merge topic".

* Fix visibility checks for `refs/meta/config`.
+
Under some conditions it was possible for the `refs/meta/config` branch to be
erroneously considerered not visible to the user.

* Sort list of updated changes in output from push.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2940[Issue 2940]:
Improve warning messages when Change-Id is missing in the commit message.

** Add a hint to amend the commit after installing the commit-msg hook.
** Don't show "Suggestion for commit message" when Change-Id is missing.


Secondary Index / Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2822[Issue 2822]:
Improve Lucene analysis of words linked with '_' or '.'.
+
Instead of treating words linked with '_' or '.' as one word, Lucene now
treats them as separate words.

* Fix support for change~branch~id in query syntax.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[remove-generate-http-password-capability]]
* Remove the 'Generate HTTP Password' capability.
+
The 'Generate HTTP Password' capability has been removed to close a security
vulnerability.  Now only administrators are allowed to generate and delete other
users' http passwords via the REST or SSH interface.
+
It is encouraged to clean up your `project.config` settings after upgrading.


Web UI
~~~~~~

Change Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Differentiate between conflicts and already merged errors in cherry-pick
+
When a cherry-pick operation failed with "Cherry pick failed" error, there was no
way to know the reason for the failure: merge conflict or the commit is already
on the target branch.  These failures are now differentiated and a proper error
is reported to the client.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2837[Issue 2837]:
Improve display of long user names for collapsed comments in history.
+
If there were several users with long user names with the same prefix, e.g.
'AutomaticGerritVoterLinux' and 'AutomaticGerritVoterWindows', they would both
be shown as 'AutomaticGerritVo...' and users had to expand the comment to see
the full user name.
+
The ellipsis is now inserted in the middle of the user name so that the start
and end of the user name are always visible, e.g. 'AutomaticG...VoterLinux' and
'AutomaticG...terWindows'.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2992[Issue 2992]:
Fix display of review comments for Chrome on Android.
+
Chrome for Android has Font Boosting, which caused the review comments to
be displayed too large.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2909[Issue 2909]:
Make change owner votes removable.
+
If a change owner voted on a change, it was not possible for anyone other
than the owner to remove the vote.

* Preserve topic when cherry-picking.
+
When a change is cherry-picked, the topic from the source change is preserved
on the newly created change.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3007[Issue 3007]:
Make the selected tab persistent.
+
If a change from the "Same Topic" tab was clicked, the selected tab would reset
to the default tab ("Related Changes").


Side-By-Side Diff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2848[Issue 2848]:
Add support for CSharp syntax highlighting.

* Remove support for syntax highlighting of Restructured Text and Go file types.
+
Syntax highlighting for these file types caused rendering failures due to a
link:https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues/2850[bug in CodeMirror].

Project Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix alignment of checkboxes on project access screen.
+
The "Exclusive" checkbox was not aligned with the other checkboxes.

REST API
~~~~~~~~

Changes
^^^^^^^

* Remove the administrator restriction on the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/rest-api-changes.html#index-change[
index change] endpoint.
+
The endpoint can now be used by any user who has visibility of the change.

* Only include account ID in responses unless `DETAILED_ACCOUNTS` option is set.
+
The behaviour was inconsistent with the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/rest-api-accounts.html#account-info[
documentation]. In the default case it was including only the account name,
rather than only the account ID.

* Include revision's ref in responses.
+
The ref of a revision was only returned as part of the fetch info, which is only
available if the download commands are installed.

* Correctly set the limit to the default when no limit is given in the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/rest-api-changes.html#suggest-reviewers[
suggest reviewers] endpoint.

Projects
^^^^^^^^

* Make it mandatory to specify at least one of the `--prefix`, `--match` or `--regex`
options in the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/rest-api-projects.html#list-projects[
list projects] endpoint.
