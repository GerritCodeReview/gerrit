TODO

Plugins
~~~~~~~

General
^^^^^^^

* Plugins can now listen to account group membership changes
+
The audit log service allows to register listeners to group member added and
group member deleted events. A default listener logs these events to the database
as before, but additional listeners may now be registered for these events using
the `GroupMemberAuditListener` interface.

Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Projects can be specified with wildcard in the `start` command.


Other
~~~~~

* The 'Generate HTTP Password' capability is removed.
+
The 'Generate HTTP Password' capability has been removed to close a security
vulnerability.  Now only administrators are allowed to generate and delete other
users' http passwords via the REST or SSH interface.
+
It is encouraged to clean up your `project.config` settings after upgrading.


Bug Fixes
---------

Change Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Differentiate between conflicts and already merged errors in cherry-pick
+
When a cherry-pick operation failed with "Cherry pick failed" error, there was no
way to know the reason for the failure: merge conflict or the commit is already
on the target branch.  These failures are now differentiated and a proper error
is reported to the client.


REST API
~~~~~~~~

Projects
^^^^^^^^

* Make it mandatory to specify at least one of the `--prefix`, `--match` or `--regex`
options in the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/rest-api-projects.html#list-projects[
list projects] endpoint.
