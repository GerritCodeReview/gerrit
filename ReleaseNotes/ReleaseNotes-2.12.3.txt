https://gerrit-releases.storage.googleapis.com/gerrit-2.12.3.war]

Gerrit 2.12.3 includes the bug fixes done with
link:ReleaseNotes-2.11.8.html[Gerrit 2.11.8] and
link:ReleaseNotes-2.11.9.html[Gerrit 2.11.9]. These bug fixes are *not*
listed in these release notes.

Schema Upgrade
--------------

*WARNING:* There are no schema changes from link:ReleaseNotes-2.12.2.html[
2.12.2] but a manual schema upgrade is necessary when upgrading from 2.12.

When upgrading a site that is already running version 2.12, the `patch_sets`
table must be manually migrated using the `gerrit gsql` SSH command or the
`gqsl` site program.

For the default H2 database, execute the command:

----
  alter table patch_sets modify push_certficate clob;
----

For MySQL, execute the command:

----
  alter table patch_sets modify push_certficate text;
----

For PostgreSQL, execute the command:

----
  alter table patch_sets alter column push_certficate type text;
----

For other database types, execute the appropriate equivalent command.

Note that the misspelled `push_certficate` is the actual name of the
column.

When upgrading from a version earlier than 2.12, or from 2.12.1 or 2.12.2
having already done the migration, this manual step is not necessary and
should be omitted.
