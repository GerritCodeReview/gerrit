== Schema Upgrade

*WARNING:* There are no schema changes from link:ReleaseNotes-2.12.3.html[
2.12.3] but a manual schema upgrade is necessary when upgrading from 2.12.

When upgrading a site that is already running version 2.12, the `patch_sets`
table must be manually migrated using the `gerrit gsql` SSH command or the
`gqsl` site program.

For the default H2 database, execute the command:

----
  alter table patch_sets modify push_certficate clob;
----

For MySQL, execute the command:

----
  alter table patch_sets modify push_certficate text;
----

For PostgreSQL, execute the command:

----
  alter table patch_sets alter column push_certficate type text;
----

For other database types, execute the appropriate equivalent command.

Note that the misspelled `push_certficate` is the actual name of the
column.

When upgrading from a version earlier than 2.12, or from 2.12.1 or 2.12.2
having already done the migration, this manual step is not necessary and
should be omitted.

== Known Issues

* link:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4323[Issue 4323]:
'value too long for type character varying(255)' in patch_sets table when
migrating to schema version 108.
+
This error may occur under some circumstances when running the schema
migration from an earlier version of Gerrit.
+
On sites where this occurs, it can be fixed with a manual schema update
according to the comments in the issue.

== Bug Fixes

* link:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4400[Issue 4400]:
Fix `AlreadyClosedException` in Lucene index.
+
If a Lucene indexing thread was interrupted by an SSH connection being
closed, this would also close file handles being used to read the index.
+
Lucene queries are now executed on background threads to isolate them
from SSH threads.
+
This may also reduce latency for user dashboards on a multi-core system as
each query for the different sections can now run on separate threads and
return results when ready.
