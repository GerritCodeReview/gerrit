Important Notes
---------------

*WARNING:* This release contains schema changes.  To upgrade:
----
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
----

*WARNING:* Upgrading to 2.12.x requires the server be first upgraded to 2.8 (or
2.9) and then to 2.12.x. If you are upgrading from 2.8.x or later, you may ignore
this warning and upgrade directly to 2.12.x.

*WARNING:* When upgrading from version 2.8.4 or older with a site that uses
Bouncy Castle Crypto, new versions of the libraries will be downloaded. The old
libraries should be manually removed from site's `lib` folder to prevent the
startup failure described in
link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3084[Issue 3084].

*WARNING:* The Solr secondary index is no longer supported. With this release
the only supported secondary index is Lucene.

+
When the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#change.submitWholeTopic[

topic will be submitted at the same time.

This setting is disabled by default.

* Submission of changes may include ancestors.
+
If a change is submitted that has submittable ancestor changes, those changes
will also be submitted.

Secondary Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes are indexed by the git author and committer of the latest patch set,
and can be searched with the `author:` and `committer:` operators.
+
Changes are matched on either the exact whole email address, or on parts of the
name or email address.

* Add `from:` search operator to match by owner of change or author of comments.

+
Plugins can now be written to allow runtime reconfiguration of various Lucene
performance related parameters.

Plugins can now temporarily turn on auto-committing in situations where it makes
sense to enforce all changes to be written to disk ASAP.

`sshd.enableCompression` setting].

Add Support for `git-upload-archive`.
+
This allows use the standard `git archive` command to create an archive
of the content of a repository.

* Add a background job to automatically abandon inactive changes.
+
The
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#changeCleanup[
changeCleanup] configuration can be set to periodically check for inactive

Apache Derby database].

* Download commands plugin: Use commit IDs for download commands when change refs are hidden.
+
Git has a configuration option to hide refs from the initial advertisement
(`uploadpack.hideRefs`). This option can be used to hide the change refs from
the client. As consequence this prevented fetching changes by change ref from
working.
+
Setting `download.checkForHiddenChangeRefs` in the `gerrit.config` to true
allows the download commands plugin to check for hidden change refs.
