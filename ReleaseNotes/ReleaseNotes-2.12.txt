Important Notes
---------------

*WARNING:* This release contains schema changes.  To upgrade:
----
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
----

*WARNING:* Upgrading to 2.12.x requires the server be first upgraded to 2.8 (or
2.9) and then to 2.12.x. If you are upgrading from 2.8.x or later, you may ignore
this warning and upgrade directly to 2.12.x.

*WARNING:* When upgrading from version 2.8.4 or older with a site that uses
Bouncy Castle Crypto, new versions of the libraries will be downloaded. The old
libraries should be manually removed from site's `lib` folder to prevent the
startup failure described in
link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3084[Issue 3084].

*WARNING:* The Solr secondary index is no longer supported. With this release
the only supported secondary index is Lucene.


Release Highlights
------------------

This release includes the following new features. See the sections below for
further details.

* New change submission workflows, "Submit Whole Topic" and "Submitted Together".

* Support for GPG Keys and signed pushes.


New Features
------------

New Change Submission Workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New "Submit Whole Topic" setting.
+
When the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#change.submitWholeTopic[
`change.submitWholeTopic`] setting is enabled, all changes belonging to the same
topic will be submitted at the same time.
+
This setting should be considered experimental, and is disabled by default.

* Submission of changes may include ancestors.
+
If a change is submitted that has submittable ancestor changes, those changes
will also be submitted.

* The merge queue is removed.
+
Changes that cannot be submitted due to missing dependencies will no longer
enter the "Submitted, Merge Pending" state.


GPG Keys and Signed Pushes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Signed push can be enabled by setting
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#receive.enableSignedPush[
`receive.enableSignedPush`] to true.
+
When a client pushes with `git push --signed`, Gerrit ensures that the push
certificate is valid and signed with a valid public key stored in the
`refs/gpg-keys` branch of the `All-Users` repository.

* When signed push is enabled, and
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.editGpgKeys[
`gerrit.editGpgKeys`] is set to true, users may upload their public GPG
key via the REST API or UI.
+
If this setting is not enabled, GPG keys may only be added by administrators
with direct access to the `All-Users` repository.

* Administrators may also configure
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#receive.certNonceSeed[
`receive.certNonceSeed`]
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#receive.certNonceSlop[
`receive.certNonceSlop`].


Secondary Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3333[Issue 3333]:
Support searching for changes by author and committer.
+
Changes are indexed by the git author and committer of the latest patch set,
and can be searched with the `author:` and `committer:` operators.
+
Changes are matched on either the exact whole email address, or on parts of the
name or email address.

* Add `from:` search operator to match by owner of change or author of comments.

* Add `commentby:` search operator to search byt author of comments.

* Change the `topic:` search operator to search by the exact topic name.

* Add `intopic:` search operator to search by topics containing the search term.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3291[Issue 3291]:
Add `has:edit` search operator to match changes that have change edits on them.

* Allow configuration of maximum query size.
+
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#index.maxTerms[
`index.maxTerms`] can be set to limit the number of leaf index terms.

* Expose Lucene index writers for plugins.
+
Plugins can now be written to allow runtime reconfiguration of various Lucene
performance related parameters.

* Make Lucene index writers auto-commit writers.
+
Plugins can now temporarily turn on auto-committing in situations where it makes
sense to enforce all changes to be written to disk ASAP.


UI
~~

General
^^^^^^^

* Edit and diff preferences can be modified from the user preferences screen.
+
Previously it was only possible to edit these preferences from the actual
diff and edit screens.

* Add "Edits" to My dashboard menu.

Project Screen

* New tab to list the project's tags, similar to the branch list.


Inline Editor

Change Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Show file size increase/decrease for binary files.

* Show uploader if different from change owner.

* Show push certificate status.

* Show change subject as tooltip on related changes list.
+
This helps to identify changes when the subject is truncated in the list.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3293[Issue 3293]:

~~~

* Add support for ZLib Compression.
+

link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#sshd.enableCompression[
`sshd.enableCompression` setting].

* Add support for hmac-sha2-256 and hmac-sha2-512 as MACs.


Other
~~~~~

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2061[Issue 2061]
Add Support for `git-upload-archive`.
+
This allows use the standard `git archive` command to create an archive
of the content of a repository.

* Add a background job to automatically abandon inactive changes.
+
The
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#changeCleanup[
changeCleanup] configuration can be set to periodically check for inactive
changes and automatically abandon them.

* Add support for the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/database-setup.html#createdb_db2[
DB2 database].

* Add support for the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/database-setup.html#createdb_derby[
Apache Derby database].

* Download commands plugin: Use commit IDs for download commands when change refs are hidden.
+
Git has a configuration option to hide refs from the initial advertisement
(`uploadpack.hideRefs`). This option can be used to hide the change refs from
the client. As consequence this prevented fetching changes by change ref from
working.
+
Setting `download.checkForHiddenChangeRefs` in the `gerrit.config` to true
allows the download commands plugin to check for hidden change refs.

Bug Fixes
---------

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3653[Issue 3653]:
Correct timezone in sshd log after DST change.
+
When encountering a DST switch, the timezone wasn't updated until
the server was reloaded.

* Make email validation case insensitive.
+
While link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-2.3.11[
RFC 5321 section 2.3.11] allows for the local-part (the part left of
the '@') of an email address to be case sensitive, the domain portion is
case insensitive according to
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-3.1[RFC 1035 section 3.1].
And in practice, even the local-part is typically case insensitive also.

* commit-msg hook: Don't add Change-Id line on temporary commits.
+
Commits created with `git commit --fixup` or `git commit --squash` are not
intended to be pushed to Gerrit, and don't need a `Change-Id` line.
+
This also prevents changes from being accidentally uploaded, at least for
projects that have the 'Require Change-Id' configuration enabled.
