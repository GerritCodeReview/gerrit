Important Notes
---------------

*WARNING:* This release contains schema changes.  To upgrade:
----
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
----

*WARNING:* To use online reindexing when upgrading to 2.12.x the server must
first be upgraded to 2.8 (or 2.9) and then through 2.10 and 2.11 to 2.12.x. If
reindexing will be done offline, you may ignore this warning and upgrade directly
to 2.12.x.

*WARNING:* When upgrading from version 2.8.4 or older with a site that uses
Bouncy Castle Crypto, new versions of the libraries will be downloaded. The old
libraries should be manually removed from site's `lib` folder to prevent the
startup failure described in
link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3084[Issue 3084].

*WARNING:* The Solr secondary index is no longer supported. With this release
the only supported secondary index is Lucene.


Release Highlights
------------------

This release includes the following new features. See the sections below for
further details.

* New change submission workflows, "Submit Whole Topic" and "Submitted Together".

* Support for GPG Keys and signed pushes.


New Features
------------

New Change Submission Workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New "Submit Whole Topic" setting.
+
When the
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#change.submitWholeTopic[
`change.submitWholeTopic`] setting is enabled, all changes belonging to the same
topic will be submitted at the same time.
+
This setting should be considered experimental, and is disabled by default.

* Submission of changes may include ancestors.
+
If a change is submitted that has submittable ancestor changes, those changes
will also be submitted.

* The merge queue is removed.
+
Changes that cannot be submitted due to missing dependencies will no longer
enter the "Submitted, Merge Pending" state.


GPG Keys and Signed Pushes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Signed push can be enabled by setting
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#receive.enableSignedPush[
`receive.enableSignedPush`] to true.
+
When a client pushes with `git push --signed`, Gerrit ensures that the push
certificate is valid and signed with a valid public key stored in the
`refs/gpg-keys` branch of the `All-Users` repository.

* When signed push is enabled, and
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.editGpgKeys[
`gerrit.editGpgKeys`] is set to true, users may upload their public GPG
key via the REST API or UI.
+
If this setting is not enabled, GPG keys may only be added by administrators
with direct access to the `All-Users` repository.

* Administrators may also configure
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#receive.certNonceSeed[
`receive.certNonceSeed`]
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#receive.certNonceSlop[
`receive.certNonceSlop`].


Secondary Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3333[Issue 3333]:
Support searching for changes by author and committer.
+
Changes are indexed by the git author and committer of the latest patch set,
and can be searched with the `author:` and `committer:` operators.
+
Changes are matched on either the exact whole email address, or on parts of the
name or email address.

* Add `from:` search operator to match by owner of change or author of comments.

* Add `commentby:` search operator to search byt author of comments.

* Change the `topic:` search operator to search by the exact topic name.

* Add `intopic:` search operator to search by topics containing the search term.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3291[Issue 3291]:
Add `has:edit` search operator to match changes that have change edits on them.

* Allow configuration of maximum query size.
+
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/config-gerrit.html#index.maxTerms[
`index.maxTerms`] can be set to limit the number of leaf index terms.

* Expose Lucene index writers for plugins.
+
Plugins can now be written to allow runtime reconfiguration of various Lucene
performance related parameters.

* Make Lucene index writers auto-commit writers.
+
Plugins can now temporarily turn on auto-committing in situations where it makes
sense to enforce all changes to be written to disk ASAP.


UI

Previously it was only possible to edit these preferences from the actual
diff and edit screens.

has an unpublished edit revision.

list.

* Download commands plugin: Use commit IDs for download commands when change refs are hidden.
+
Git has a configuration option to hide refs from the initial advertisement
(`uploadpack.hideRefs`). This option can be used to hide the change refs from
the client. As consequence this prevented fetching changes by change ref from
working.

allows the download commands plugin to check for hidden change refs.

+

and queues, and invoke the index REST API on changes.


Bug Fixes
---------

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3499[Issue 3499]:
Fix syntax highlighting of raw string literals in go.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3643[Issue 3643]:
Fix syntax highlighting of ES6 string templating using backticks.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3653[Issue 3653]:
Correct timezone in sshd log after DST change.
+
When encountering a DST switch, the timezone wasn't updated until
the server was reloaded.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3306[Issue 3306]:
Allow admins to read, push and create on `refs/users/default`.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3212[Issue 3212]:
Fix failure to run `init` when `--site-path` option is not explicitly given.

* Make email validation case insensitive.
+
While link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-2.3.11[
RFC 5321 section 2.3.11] allows for the local-part (the part left of
the '@') of an email address to be case sensitive, the domain portion is
case insensitive according to
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-3.1[RFC 1035 section 3.1].
And in practice, even the local-part is typically case insensitive also.

* commit-msg hook: Don't add Change-Id line on temporary commits.
+
Commits created with `git commit --fixup` or `git commit --squash` are not
intended to be pushed to Gerrit, and don't need a `Change-Id` line.
+
This also prevents changes from being accidentally uploaded, at least for
projects that have the 'Require Change-Id' configuration enabled.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3444[Issue 3444]:
download-commands plugin: Fix clone with commit-msg hook when project name
contains '/'.

* Include full ref names in `ref-updated` events.
+
The link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12/json.html#refUpdate[
refUpdate attribute] in `ref-updated` events did not include the full name
of the ref, i.e. `master` instead of `refs/heads/master`.
