Important Notes
---------------


*WARNING:* Upgrading to 2.12.x requires the server be first upgraded to 2.8 (or
2.9) and then to 2.12.x. If you are upgrading from 2.8.x or later, you may ignore
this warning and upgrade directly to 2.12.x.

*WARNING:* When upgrading from version 2.8.4 or older with a site that uses
Bouncy Castle Crypto, new versions of the libraries will be downloaded. The old
libraries should be manually removed from site's `lib` folder to prevent the
startup failure described in
