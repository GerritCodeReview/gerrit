Fix malformed account suggestions.
+
If the query contained several query terms and one of the query terms was
a substring of 'strong', the suggestion was malformed.

change number.

* Check for CLA when creating project config changes from the web UI.
+
If contributor agreements were enabled and required for a project, and
the user had not signed a CLA, it was still possible to upload changes
for review on `refs/meta/config` by making changes in the project access
editor and pressing 'Save for Review'.
