== Important Notes

== Release Highlights

* Support for Large File Storage (LFS).

* Metrics interface.

* Hooks plugin.

* File annotations (blame) in side-by-side diff.

== New Features

=== Large File Storage (LFS)

Gerrit provides an
link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-plugins.html#lfs-extension[
extension point] that enables development of plugins implementing the
link:https://github.com/github/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/api/v1/http-v1-batch.md[
LFS protocol].

By setting
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/config-gerrit.html#lfs.plugin[
`lfs.plugin`] the administrator can configure the name of the plugin
which handles LFS requests.

=== Metrics

Metrics about Gerrit's internal state can be sent to external
monitoring systems.

The following metrics are supported:

* HTTP responses
+
TODO details here and in the others

* REST API calls

* SSH sessions

* Caches

* SQL connections

* TODO add more


Plugins can provide implementations of the metrics interface to
report metrics to different monitoring systems. The following
plugins are available:

* link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/plugins/metrics-reporter-jmx[
JMX]

* link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/plugins/metrics-reporter-graphite[
Graphite]

* link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/plugins/metrics-reporter-elasticsearch[
Elasticsearch]


Plugins can also provide metrics.  The following metrics are provided
by the replication plugin:

* Replication latency

* Replication delay

* Replication retry

=== Hooks

Server side hooks are moved to the
link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/plugins/hooks[
hooks plugin]. Sites that make use of server side hooks should install this
plugin.

=== Change and Diff Screens

* Blame annotations
+
By enabling
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/config-gerrit.html#change.allowBlame[
`change.allowBlame`], blame annotations can be shown in the side-by-side diff
screen gutter. Clicking the annotation opens the relevant change.

* link:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=106[Issue 106]:
Allow to select parent for diff base in change screen.

* Allow to remove specific votes from a change, while leaving the reviewer
on the change.

=== Changes

In order to avoid potentially confusing behavior, when submitting changes in a
batch, submit type rules may not be used to mix submit types on a single branch,
and trying to submit such a batch will fail.

=== REST API
