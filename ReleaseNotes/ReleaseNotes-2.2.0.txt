== Schema Change
*WARNING:* Upgrading to 2.2.0 requires the server be first upgraded
to 2.1.7, and then to 2.2.0.

*WARNING:* This release contains schema changes.  To upgrade:
----
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
----

*WARNING:* The "projects" and "ref_rights" tables are no longer
stored in the SQL database. The tables have been moved to Git
storage, inside of the `refs/meta/config` branch of each managed
Git repository. The init based upgrade tool will automatically
export the current table contents and create the Git data.

== New Features

=== Project Administration
* issue 436 List projects by scanning the managed Git directory
+
Instead of generating the list of projects from SQL database, the
project list is obtained by recursively scanning the Git directory.
Adding new projects is now simply a matter of creating the Git
repository under the directory and flushing the "projects" cache
to force the server to rescan the directory. Administrators may
also continue to use `gerrit create-project`.

* Move "projects" table into Git
+
The projects table columns are now stored in the `project.config`
file of the `refs/meta/config` branch of each managed Git repository.

* Move "ref_rights" table into Git
+
The "ref_rights" table is now stored in the "access" sections of
the `project.config` file on the `refs/meta/config` branch of each
managed Git repository. This brings version control auditing to the
access data of each project.

* New project Access screen to edit access controls
+
The Access panel of the project administration has been rewritten
with a new UI that reflects the new Git based storage format.

== Bug Fixes

=== Project Administration
* Avoid unnecessary updates to $GIT_DIR/description
+
Gerrit always tried to rewrite the gitweb "description" file when the
project was modified. This lead to unnecessary changes in the local
filesystem, leading to more data to rsync to backups than necessary.
Fixed to only update the file if the content changes.
