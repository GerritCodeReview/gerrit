== Security Fixes
* Some access control sections may be ignored
+
Gerrit sometimes ignored an access control section in a project
if the exact same section name appeared in All-Projects. The bug
required an unrelated project to have access.inheritFrom set to
All-Projects and be accessed before the project that has the same
section name as All-Projects. This is an unlikely scenario for
most servers, as Gerrit does not normally set inheritFrom equal to
All-Projects. The usual behavior is to not supply this property in
project.config, and permit the implicit inheritance to take place.
