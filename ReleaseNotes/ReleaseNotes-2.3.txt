* Fix: Supress "Error on refs/cache-automerge" warnings.

* Adds --description (-d) option to ls-projects
+
Allows listing of projects together with their respective
description.

* Fix NPE in set-project-parent command if parent is not specified

* set-parent-project: evict child projects from project cache

* On group rename update the group name in the page title

* Fix 'No source code is available for type org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Constants'

* Make 'Anonymous Coward' configurable

* Verify the case of the project name before opening git repository

* Enable case insensitive login to Gerrit WebUI for LDAP authentication
+
Gerrit treats user names as case sensitive, while some LDAP servers
don't. On first login to Gerrit the user enters his user name and
Gerrit queries LDAP for it. Since LDAP is case-insensitive with regards
to  the username, the LDAP authentication succeeds regardless in
which case the user typed in his user name. The username is stored in
Gerrit exactly as entered by the user. For further logins the user
always has to use the same case. If the user specifies his user name in
a different case Gerrit tries to create a new account which fails with
"Cannot assign user name ... to account ...; name already in use.".
This error occurs because the LDAP query resolves to the same LDAP
user and storing the username for SSH (which is by default always
lower case) fails because such an entry exists already for the first
account that the user created.
+
This change introduces a new configuration parameter that converts the
user name always to lower case before doing the LDAP authentication.
By this the login to the Gerrit WebUI gets case insensitive. If this
configuration parameter is set, the user names for all existing
accounts have to be converted to lower case. This change includes a
server program to do this conversion.

* ContainerAuthFilter: fail with FORBIDDEN if username not set

* Enable case insensitive authentication for git operations
+
A new configuration parameter is introduced that converts the username
that is received to authenticate a git operation to lower case for
looking up the user account in Gerrit.
+
By setting this parameter a case insensitive authentication for the
git operations can be achieved, if it is ensured that the usernames in
Gerrit (scheme 'username') are stored in lower case (e.g. if the
parameter 'ldap.accountSshUserName' is set to
'${sAMAccountName.toLowerCase}').

* Add new SSH command to rename groups

* Rename '-- All Projects --' in documentation to 'All-Projects'

* issue 871 Show latest patchset with cherry-picked merge
+
When a change is published via the cherry-pick merge strategy,
show the final commit as a patchset in the change history.
This now makes it possible to search for the cherry-picked SHA1.

* issue 981 Fix diffs skipping one line
+
Don't show '... skipping 1 common line ...'.  The text to show this
takes up just as much space as showing the line which was skipped.

* Added more verbose messages when changes are being rejected

* ls-projects: new option to list all accessible projects
+
Add a new option '--all' to the 'ls-projects' SSH command to display
all projects that are accessible by the calling user account. Besides
the projects that the calling user account has been granted 'READ'
access to, this includes all projects that are owned by the calling
user account (even if for these projects the 'READ' access right is
not assigned to the calling user account).

* Update gwtexpui to 1.2.5
+
This fixes hyperlinks of URLs containing -.

* Resolve 'Project Owners' group if it is included into another group

* Hide SSH URL in email footers if SSH is disabled

* Removed superfluous 'comment' for patch history table.

* Redirect the user to the reverted change (when reverting).

* Customize link-name pointing to gitweb-service.
+
Previously the link to the external gitweb-type
pages said "(gitweb)" regardless if using cgit
or a custom service.

* issue 18 Support expanding lines of context in diff
+
Allow lines of context which were skipped in the side-by-side diff
view to be expanded.  This makes it easier to get more code context
when needed but not show huge amounts of unneeded data.

* Fix calculation of project name if repo is not existing
+
If a project inherits from a non existing parent, prevent a
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.

* Sort the jar files from the war before adding to classpath.

* Prevent comments spam for abandoned commit
+
If some change was abandoned but later submitted (e.g. by
cherry-picking it to a another branch) then pushing a new branch
that contains this change no longer adds a new comment.

* Apply user preferences when loading site

* Don't allow registering for cleanup after cleanup runs
+
This prevents leaking a database connection.

* Ensure HttpLog can always get the user identity

* Support gitweb.type=disabled

* Package source JARs for antlr, httpd, server

* Avoid NPE when group is missing

* Fix token saving redirect in container auth
+
Update the jump page that redirects users from /#TOKEN to
/login/TOKEN.  This forces using the container based
authentication.  Also correct "/login//" to be just "/login/".

* rules.enable: Support disabling per project prolog rules in gerrit.config

* Allow disabling certain features of HostPageServlet
+
These features are: user agent detection and automatic refresh
logic associated with the site header, footer and CSS.

+
This only seems to matter to IntelliJ, since the Main class is
provided to the war via an overlay in gerrit-war/pom.xml

* Try to use transactions when creating changes

* gerrit.sh: disown doesn't accept pid as a argument, fix script

* gerrit.sh: detach gerrit properly so it won't keep bad ssh sessions open.

* Cache list of all groups in the group cache

* Add ssh command to list groups.

* ls-groups: add option to list groups for a project
+
Add an option to the ls-groups SSH command that allows to list only
those groups for which any permission is assigned to a project.

* ls-groups: Add option to only list groups that are visible to all

* ls-groups: Support listing groups by group type

* Fix miscellaneous compiler warnings

This helps prevent a very slow LDAP server from blocking
all SSH command creation threads.

* Added additional information on the install instructions.

* Access control documentation: Reordering categories

* Display proper error message when LDAP is unavailable

* Support reparenting all children of a parent project
+
This change adds a new option to the 'set-project-parent' command that
allows reparenting all child projects of one parent project to another
parent project.

* issue 349 Apply states for projects (active, readonly and hidden)
+
Active state indicates the project is regular and is the default value.
+
Read Only means that users can see the project if read permission is
granted, but all modification operations are disabled.
+
Hidden means the project is not visible for those who are not owners

* issue 807 Fix: Tags are not replicated properly

* Output full commit message in query results

* Add property to configure path separator in URLs for a gitweb service

* ls-groups: Support listing of groups for a user

+
"--force-message" option for the SSHD review command,
which allows Gerrit to publish the "--message", even if the
labels could not be applied due to change being closed.

* Support replication to local folder

* Update JGit to 1.1.0.201109151100-r.119-gb4495d1
+
This is needed because of this change:
https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/30450/

* Introduce a git maxObjectSizeLimit in the [recieve] config

Ensure clients see messages related to contributor agreement not
being activated even if they push over HTTP.

* Clarify error msg when user's not allowed to '--force push'.

* Connect Velocity to slf4j

* Expose project permissionOnly status via JSON-RPC

* Documentation: Introducing a quick and dirty setup tutorial
+
The new document covers quick installation, new project and first upload.
It contains lots of quoted output, with a demo style to it.

* First Cut of Gerrit Walkthrough Introduction documentation.
+
Intended to be a complement for the existing reference documentation to allow
potential users to easily get a feel for how Gerrit is used, where it fits
and whether it will work for them.

* Add entries to .gitignore for m2e settings/preference files

* New draft statuses and magic branches
+
Adds draft status to Change. DRAFT status in change occurs before NEW
and will be for a change that is not meant for review (yet).
Also adds magic branches refs/draft/ and refs/publish/ that
will handle whether or not a patchset is a draft or goes straight to
review. refs/for/ should be deprecated in favor of explicitly marking
a patchset as a draft or directly to review.

* Draft patchset and change visibility in UI
+
If a patchset is a draft, adds a (DRAFT) label next to the revision
(or gitweb link if it exists). If a change is a draft, adds a (DRAFT)
next to the subject and changes the status appropriately.

* Publish draft patchsets in UI and SSH
+
Adds Publish button to draft patchsets in UI and an option to
publish draft patchsets in the review ssh command. Publishing a draft
patchset makes it visible. Publishing a draft patchset in a draft
change irreversibly upgrades the change status to NEW.

* Delete draft changes and patchsets
+
Adds ability to delete draft changes and patchsets that are not meant
or fit for code review. Deleting a draft patchset also deletes the
corresponding ref from the repository and decrements the next patch
set number for the change if necessary. Deleting a draft change
deletes all of its (draft) patchsets.

* Add pushing drafts to refs/draft/
+
Pushing to refs/draft/ will now push a draft patchset. If this is the
first patch set, change created will be in draft status. Pushing a
draft patchset to a draft change keeps it in draft status. Pushing
a non-draft patchset (with refs/publish/ or refs/for/, they do the
same thing) to a draft change turns it into a non-draft change.
Draft patchsets cannot be submitted.

* set-project-parent: if update of 1 project fails continue with others

* Fix git push authentication over HTTP

* Fix http://login/ redirect bug

* Make OpenID login images transparent

* Allow superprojects to subscribe to submodules updates
+
The feature introduced in this commit allows superprojects to
subscribe to submodules updates.
+
When a commit is merged to a project, the commit content is scanned
to identify if it registers submodules (if the commit contains new
gitlinks and .gitmodules file with required info) and if so, a new
submodule subscription is registered.
+
When a new commit of a registered submodule is merged, gerrit
automatically updates the subscribers to the submodule with new
commit having the updated gitlinks.
+
The most notable benefit of the feature is to not require
to push/merge commits of super projects (subscribers) with gitlinks
whenever a project being a submodule is updated. It is only
required to push commits with gitlinks when they are created
(and in this case it is also required to push .gitmodules file).

* issue 203 Create project through web interface
+
Add a new panel in the Admin->Projects Screen.  It
enables the users that are allowed to create projects
via command-line to create them also via web interface.

* Move checkbox to mark file as reviewed into title bar

* Allow Realm to participate when linking an account identity
+
When linking a new user identity to an exisiting account, permit the
Realm to observe the new incoming identity and the current account,
and to alter the request. This enables a Realm to observe when a
user verifies a new email address link.

* Support http://server/project for Git access

* Use _ instead of $ for implementation-detail Prolog predicates

* Access control documentation: Create reference

* Access control documentation: Forge identity

* Access control documentation: Owner and Push

* Access control documentation: Push Merge

* Access control documentation: Push Annotated Tags

* Access control documentation: Read and Submit

* Update the Sign In anchor with current URL
+
Always update the href of the Sign In anchor in the menu bar with
the current page URL after /login/, making the redirect process
bring users back to the current view after sign in.

* Improve validation of email registration tokens

* Improve 'Push Merge Commit' access right documentation

* Avoid potential NPE when querying the queue.

* Documentation: Bypass review updated with 2.2.x permissions

* Suggest parent for 'create-project' in the SSH command
+
Add an option '--suggest-parents' which will print out
a list of projects that are already parents to another
projects, thus it can help user to find a suitable
parent for the new project.

* Fix missing targets in /login/ URLs

* Documentation: Add documentation for 'peer_keys'

* Only send mail to author and committer if they are registered to prevent an NPE

* issue 871 Display hash of the cherry-pick merge in comment

* Update top level SUBMITTING_PATCHES URLs

* Update pom to gwtorm 1.2 Release

* Suggest parent for 'create-project' in the UI.
+
Add a list of parent suggestions for 'create project'
in the UI, so the user can select a parent for the new
project from a list of projects that are already parents to
other projects.
