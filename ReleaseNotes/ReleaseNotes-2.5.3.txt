* Patch vulnerabilities in OpenID client library

Installations using OpenID for authentication were vulnerable to a
number of attacks over the network.  The openid4java client library
was identified as the entry point.  In this release Gerrit updated to
the latest 0.9.8 release, which patches the known attack vectors.

No other changes since 2.5.2.
