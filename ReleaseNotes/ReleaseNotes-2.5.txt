Release notes for Gerrit 2.5
============================

Gerrit 2.5 is now available:

link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/downloads/detail?name=gerrit-2.5.war[http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/downloads/detail?name=gerrit-2.5.war]

Gerrit 2.5 includes the bug fixes done with
link:ReleaseNotes-2.4.1.html[Gerrit 2.4.1] and
link:ReleaseNotes-2.4.2.html[Gerrit 2.4.2]. These bug fixes are *not*
listed in these release notes.

Schema Change
-------------
*WARNING:* This release contains schema changes.  To upgrade:
----
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
----

*WARNING:* Upgrading to 2.5.x requires the server be first upgraded to 2.1.7 (or
a later 2.1.x version), and then to 2.5.x.  If you are upgrading from 2.2.x.x or
newer, you may ignore this warning and upgrade directly to 2.5.x.

Upgrade Warnings
----------------

[[replication]]
Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~

Gerrit 2.5 no longer includes replication support out of the box.
Servers that reply upon `replication.config` to copy Git repository
data to other locations must also install the replication plugin.

Cache Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Disk caches are now backed by individual H2 databases, rather than
Ehcache's own private format. Administrators are encouraged to clear
the `'$site_path'/cache` directory before starting the new server.

The `cache.NAME.diskLimit` configuration variable is now expressed in
bytes of disk used. This is a change from previous versions of Gerrit,
which expressed the limit as the number of entries rather than bytes.
Bytes of disk is a more accurate way to size what is held. Admins that
set this variable must update their configurations, as the old values
are too small. For example a setting of `diskLimit = 65535` will only
store 64 KiB worth of data on disk and can no longer hold 65,000 patch
sets. It is recommended to delete the diskLimit variable (if set) and
rely on the built-in default of `128m`.

The `cache.diff.memoryLimit` and `cache.diff_intraline.memoryLimit`
configuration variables are now expressed in bytes of memory used,
rather than number of entries in the cache. This is a change from
previous versions of Gerrit and gives administrators more control over
how memory is partioned within a server. Admins that set this variable
must update their configurations, as the old values are too small.
For example a setting of `memoryLimit = 1024` now means only 1 KiB of
data (which may not even hold 1 patch set), not 1024 patch sets.  It
is recommended to set these to `10m` for 10 MiB of memory, and
increase as necessary.

The `cache.NAME.maxAge` variable now means the maximum amount of time
that can elapse between reads of the source data into the cache, no
matter how often it is being accessed. In prior versions it meant how
long an item could be held without being requested by a client before
it was discarded. The new meaning of elapsed time before consulting
the source data is more useful, as it enables a strict bound on how
stale the cached data can be. This is especially useful for slave
servers account and permission data, or the `ldap_groups` cache, where
updates are often made to the source without telling Gerrit to reload
the cache.

New Features
------------

Plugins
~~~~~~~

The Gerrit server functionality can be extended by installing plugins.
Depending on how tightly the extension code is coupled with the Gerrit
server code, there is a distinction between
link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#plugin[plugins] and
link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#extension[extensions].

* link:#replication[Move replication logic to replication plugin]
+
This splits all of the replication code out of the core server
and moves it into a standard plugin.

* link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html[Documentation about
  plugin development] including instructions for:
** link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#getting-started[how to get
   started with plugin development]
** link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#deployment[plugin
   deployment/installation]

* link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#API[API for plugins and
  extensions]

* Support for link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#ssh[SSH command
  plugins]
+
Allows plugin developers to declare additional SSH commands.

* Enable link:#ssh-alias[aliases for SSH commands]
+
Site administrators can alias SSH commands from a plugin into the
`gerrit` namespace.
+
The aliases are configured statically at server startup, but are
resolved dynamically at invocation time to the currently loaded
version of the plugin. If the plugin is not loaded, or does not
define the command, "not found" is returned to the user.

* Support for link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#http[HTTP
  plugins]
+
Plugins may contribute to the /plugins/NAME/ URL space.

* Automatic registration of plugin bindings
+
If a plugin has no modules declared in the manifest, automatically
generate the modules for the plugin based on the class files that
appear in the plugin and the `@Export` annotations that appear on
these concrete classes.
+
For any non-abstract command that extends SshCommand, plugins may
declare the command with `@Export("name")` to
link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#ssh[bind the implementation
as that SSH command].
+
Likewise link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#http[HTTP servlets
can also be bound to URLs].

* link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#data-directory[Support a data
  directory for plugins on demand]

* Support serving static/ and Documentation/ from plugins
+
The static/ and Documentation/ resource directories of a plugin can be
served over HTTP for any loaded and running plugin, even if it has no
other HTTP handlers. This permits a plugin to supply icons or other
graphics for the web UI, or documentation content to help users learn
how to use the plugin.

* link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#documentation[Auto-formatting
  of plugin HTTP pages from Markdown files]
+
If Gerrit detects that a requested plugin resource does not exist, but
instead a file with a `.md` extension does exist, Gerrit opens the
`.md` file and reformats it as html.

* Support of link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#macros[macros in
  Markdown plugin documentation]

* link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#auto-index[Automatic
  generation of an index for the plugin documentation]

* Support for audit plugins
+
Plugins can implement an `AuditListener` to be informed about auditable
actions:
+
----
  @Listener
  public class MyAuditTrail extends AuditListener
----
+
The plugin must define a plugin module that binds the implementation of
the audit listener in the `configure()` method:
+
----
  DynamicSet.bind(binder(), AuditListener.class).to(MyAuditTrail.class);
----

* Web UI for plugins
+
Administrators can see the list of installed plugins in the WebUI
under `Admin` > `Plugins`. For each plugin the plugin status is shown
and it is possible to navigate to the plugin documentation.

* Servlet to list plugins
+
Administrators can retrieve plugin information from a REST interface
by loading `<server-url>/a/plugins/`.

* Support SSH commands to
** link:../Documentation/cmd-plugin-ls.html[list the installed
   plugins]
** link:../Documentation/cmd-plugin-install.html[install plugins]
** link:../Documentation/cmd-plugin-enable.html[enable plugins]
** link:../Documentation/cmd-plugin-remove.html[disable plugins]
** link:../Documentation/cmd-plugin-reload.html[reload plugins]

* Support installation of core plugin on site initialization

* Automatically load/unload/reload plugins
+
The PluginScanner thread runs every 1 minute by default and loads any
newly created plugins, unloads any deleted plugins, and reloads any
plugins that have been modified.
+
The check frequency can be configured by setting
link:../Documentation/config-gerrit.html#plugins.checkFrequency[
plugins.checkFrequency] in the Gerrit config file. By configuration
the scanner can also be disabled.

* link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#classpath[Loading of plugins
  in own ClassLoader]

* Plugin cleanup in the background
+
When a plugin is stopped, schedule a Plugin Cleaner task to run
1 minute later to try and clean out the garbage and release the
JAR from `$site_path/tmp`.

* Export `LifecycleListener` as extension point
+
Extensions may need to know when they are starting or stopping.
Export the interface that they can use to learn this information.

* Support injection of `ServerInformation` into extensions and plugins
+
Plugins can take this value by injection and learn the current
server state during their own LifecycleListener. This enables a
plugin to determine if it is loading as part of server startup, or
because it was dynamically installed or reloaded by an administrator.

* link:../Documentation/dev-plugins.html#getting-started[Maven
  archetype for creating gerrit plugin projects]

REST API
~~~~~~~~
Gerrit now supports a REST like API available over HTTP. The API is
suitable for automated tools to build upon, as well as supporting some
ad-hoc scripting use cases.

* link:../Documentation/rest-api.html[Documentation of the REST API]

* Support REST endpoints to
** link:../Documentation/rest-api.html#changes[query changes]
** link:../Documentation/rest-api.html#projects[list projects]
** link:../Documentation/rest-api.html#suggest-projects[suggest
   projects]
** link:../Documentation/rest-api.html#accounts_self_capabilities[query
   the global capabilities of the calling user]

* Support link:../Documentation/rest-api.html#authentication[anonymous
  and authenticated access] to the REST endpoints

* Support link:../Documentation/rest-api.html#output[JSON output
  format] for the REST endpoints

The new REST API is used from the Gerrit WebUI.

Some of the methods from the old internal JSON-RPC interface were
completely replaced by the new REST API and got deleted:

* `ProjectAdminService.visibleProjects(AsyncCallback<ProjectList>)`
* `ProjectAdminService.suggestParentCandidates(AsyncCallback<List<Project>>)`
* `ChangeListService.myStarredChangeIds(AsyncCallback<Set<Change.Id>>)`
* `ChangeListService.allQueryNext(String, String, int, AsyncCallback<SingleListChangeInfo>)`
* `ChangeListService.allQueryPrev(String, String, int, AsyncCallback<SingleListChangeInfo>)`
* `ChangeListService.forAccount(Account.Id, AsyncCallback<AccountDashboardInfo>)`

[[query-deprecation]]
In addition the `/query` API has been deprecated. By default it is
still available but server administrators may disable it by setting
the link:../Documentation/config-gerrit.html#site.enableDeprecatedQuery[
`site.enableDeprecatedQuery`] parameter in the Gerrit config file. This
allows to enforce tools to move to the new API.

Web
~~~

Change Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Display commit message in a box
+
The commit message on the change screen is now placed in a box with a
title and emphasis on the commit summary. The star icon and the
permalink are displayed in the box header. The header from the change
screen is removed as it only held duplicate information.

* Open the dependency section automatically when the change is needed
  by an open change

* Only show a change as needed by if its current patch set depends on
  the change

* Show only changes of the same project in the 'Depends On' section
+
If two projects share the same history it can happen that the same
commit is pushed for both projects, resulting in two changes. If now
a successor commit is pushed for one of the projects, the resulting
successor change was wrongly listing both changes in the 'Depends On'
section. Now only the predecessor change of the own project is listed.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1383[issue 1383]:
  Display the approval table on the PublishCommentsScreen.
+
So far the approval table that shows the reviewers and their current
votes was only shown on the ChangeScreen. Now it is also shown on the
PublishCommentScreen. This allows the reviewer to see all existing
votes and reviewers when doing their own voting and publishing of
comments. Seeing the existing votes helps the reviewer in
understanding which votes are still required before the change can be
submitted.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1380[issue 1380]:
  Display time next to change comments
+
When a comment was posted yesterday, or any time older than 1 day but
less than 1 year ago, display the time too. Display "May 2 17:37" rather
than just "May 2".

* Only show "Can Merge" when the change is new or draft

* Disable submit button if merge will fail
+
Only if link:../Documentation/config-gerrit.html#changeMerge[
`changeMerge.test = true`].

* Allow auto suggesting reviewers to draft changes
+
Auto completing users for draft changes did't work as the other
users didn't have access to the drafts. The visibility check for
the reviewer suggestion is now skipped.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1294[issue 1294]:
  Shorten subject of parent commit for displaying in the UI
+
If the parent commit has a very long subject (> 80 characters) shorten
the subject for displaying it in the Gerrit web UI on the change screen.
This avoids that the 'Parent(s)' cell for the patch set becomes very
wide.

* If subject is shortened for displaying in the UI indicate this by '...'
+
If a commit has a very long subject line (> 80 characters) it is
shortened when it is displayed in the Gerrit Web UI. Indicate to the
user that the subject was shortened by appending '...' to the shortened
subject.
+
Also the subject is now cropped after a whitespace if possible.

* Insert Change-Id for revert commits
+
The 'Revert Change' action on a merged change allows to create a new
change that reverts the merged change. The commit message of the revert
commit now contains a Change-Id.
+
It is convenient if a Change-Id is automatically created and inserted
into the commit message of the revert commit since it makes rebasing of
the revert commit easier.

* Use more gentle shade of red to highlight outdated dependencies

Patch Screens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* New patch screen header
+
A new patch screen header was added that is displayed above both the
side-by-side and unified views. The new header contains actual links to
the available patchsets and shows which patchset is being currently
displayed.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1192[issue 1192]:
  Add download links to the unified diff view

* Improvement of the side-by-side viewer table
+
The line number column for the right side was moved to be on the far
right of the table, so that the layout now looks like this:
+
----
  1 |  foo       |       bar   | 1
  2 |  hello     |       hello | 2
----
+
This looks nicer when reading a lot of code, as the line numbers are
less relevant than the code itself which is now in the center of the
UI.
+
Line numbers are still links to create comment editors, but they
use a light shade of gray and skip the underline decoration, making
them less visually distracting.
+
Skip lines now use a paler shade of blue and also hide the fact they
contain anchors, until you hover over them and the anchor shows up.
+
The expand before and after are changed to be arrows showing in
which direction the lines will appear above or below the skip
line.

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=626[issue 626]:
  Option to display line endings
+
There is a new user preference that allows to display Windows EOL/Cr-Lf.
'\r' is shown in a dotted-line box (similar to how '\r' is displayed in
GitWeb).

* Streamlined review workflow
+
A link was added next to the "Reviewed" checkbox that marks the current
patch as reviewed and goes to the next unreviewed patch.

User Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Support for link:../Documentation/user-custom-dashboards.html[custom
  dashboards]

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1407[issue 1407]:
  Improve highlighting of unreviewed changes in the user's dashboard
+
A change will be highlighted as unreviewed if
+
. the user is reviewer of the change but hasn't published any change
  message for the current patch set
. the user has published a change message for the current patch set,
  but afterwards the change owner has published a change message on
  the change

* Sort outgoing reviews in the user dashboard by created date

* Sort incoming reviews in the user dashboard by updated date
+
Sorting the incoming reviews by last updated date, descending, places
the most recently updated reviews at the top of the list for a user,
and the oldest stale at the bottom. This may help users to identify
items to take immediate action on, as they appear closer to the top.

Access Rights Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Display error if modifying access rights for a ref is forbidden
+
If a user is owner of at least one ref he is able to edit the access
rights on a project. If he adds access rights for other refs, these
access rights were silently ignored on save. Instead of this now an
error message is displayed to inform the user that he doesn't have
permissions to do the update for these refs.
+
In case of such an error the project access screen stays in the edit
mode so that the unsaved modifications are not lost. The user may now
propose the changes to the access rights through code review.

* Allow to propose changes to access rights through code review
+
Users that are able to upload changes for code review for the
`refs/meta/config` branch can now propose changes to the project access
rights through code review directly from the ProjectAccessScreen.
+
When editing the project access rights there is a new button
'Save for Review' which will create a new change for the access
rights modifications. Project owners are automatically added as
reviewer to this change. If a project owner agrees to the access rights
modifications he can simply approve and submit the change.

* Show all access rights in WebUI if user can read `refs/meta/config`
+
Users who can read the `refs/meta/config` branch, can see all access
rights by fetching this branch and looking at the `project.config`
file. Now they can see the same information in the web UI.

* Allow extra group suggestions for project owners
+
When suggesting groups to a user, only groups that are visible to the
user are suggested. These are those group that the user is member of.
For project owners now also groups to which they are not a member are
suggested when editing the access rights of the project.

Other
^^^^^

* Ask user to login if change is not found
+
Accessing a change URL was failing with 'Application Error - The page
you requested was not found, or you do not have permission to view this
page' if the user was not signed in and the change was not visible to
`Anonymous Users`. Instead Gerrit now asks the user to login and
afterwards shows the change to the user if it exists and is visible.
If the change doesn't exist or is not visible, the user will still get
the NotFoundScreen after sign in.

* Link to owner query from user names
+
Instead of linking from a user name to the user's dashboards, link to
a search for changes owned by that user.

* On project creation allow choosing the parent project from a popup
+
In the create project UI a user can now browse all projects and select
one as parent for the new project.

* Check for open changes on branch deletion
+
Check for open changes when deleting a branch in the Gerrit WebUI.
Delete a branch only if there are no open changes for this branch.
This makes users aware of open changes when deleting a branch.

* Enable ProjectBranchesScreen for the `All-Projects` project
+
This allows to see the branches of the `All-Projects` project in the
web UI.

* Move form for group creation to own screen
+
Move the form for the group creation from the GroupListScreen to an
own new CreateGroupScreen and add a link to this screen at the
beginning of the GroupListScreen. The link to the CreateGroupScreen is
only visible if the user has the permission to create new groups.

* When adding a user to a group create an account for the user if needed
+
Trying to add a user to a group that doesn't have an account fails with
'... is not a registered user.'. Now adding a user to a group does not
immediately fail if there is no account for the user, but it tries to
authenticate the user and if the authentication is successful a user
account is automatically created, so that the user can be added to the
group. This only works if LDAP is used as user backend.
+
This allows to add users to groups that did not log in into Gerrit
before.

* Differentiate between draft changes and draft comments
+
Show the draft changes of the user when he clicks on `My` > `Drafts`.
The user's draft comments are now available under `My` >
`Draft Comments`.

* Show NotFoundScreen if a user that can't create projects tries to
  access the ProjectCreationScreen

Access Rights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Restrict rebasing of a change in the web UI to the change owner and
  the submitter

* Add a new link:../Documentation/access-control.html#category_rebase[
  access right to permit rebasing changes in the web UI]

* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=930[issue 930]:
  Add new link:../Documentation/access-control.html#category_abandon[
  access right for abandoning changes]

* Check if user can upload in order to restore
+
Restoring a change is similar to uploading a new change. If a branch
gets closed by removing the access rights to upload new changes it
shouldn't be possible to restore changes for this branch.

* Make read access to `refs/meta/config` by default exclusive to
  project owners
+
When initializing a new site a set of default access rights is
configured on the `All-Projects` project. These default access rights
include read access on `refs/*` for `Anonymous Users` and read access
on `refs/meta/config` for `Project Owners`. Since the read access on
`refs/meta/config` for `Project Owners` was not exclusive,
`Anonymous users` were able to access the `refs/meta/config` branch
which by default should only be accessible by the project owners.

Search
~~~~~~
* Offer suggestions for the search operators in the search panel
+
There are many search operators and it's difficult to remember all of
them. Now the search operators are suggested as the user types the
query.

* Support alias `self` in queries
+
Writing an expression like "owner:self status:open" will now identify
changes that the caller owns and are still open. This `self` alias
is valid in contexts where a user is expected as an argument to a
query operator.

* Add parent(s) revision information to output of query command

* Add owner username to output of query command

* `/query` API has been link:#query-deprecation[deprecated]

SSH
~~~
* link:http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1095[issue 1095]
  link:../Documentation/cmd-set-account.html[SSH command to manage
  accounts]

* link:../Documentation/cmd-set-project.html[SSH command to manage
  project settings]

* link:../Documentation/cmd-ban-commit.html[SSH command to ban
  commits]

[[ssh-alias]]
* Enable aliases for SSH commands
+
Site administrators can define aliases for SSH commands in the
link:../Documentation/config-gerrit.html#ssh-alias[`ssh-alias` section]
of the Gerrit configuration.

* Support JSON output format for the
  link:../Documentation/cmd-ls-projects.html[ls-projects] SSH command

* Support creation of multiple branches in
  link:../Documentation/cmd-create-project.html[create-project] SSH
  command
+
In case if a project has some kind of waterfall automerging
a->b->c it is convenient to create all these branches at the
project creation time.
+
e.g. '.. gerrit create-project -b master -b foo -b bar ...'

* Add verbose output option to
  link:../Documentation/cmd-ls-groups.html[ls-groups] command
+
The verbose mode enabled by the new option makes the ls-groups
command output a tab-separated table containing all available
information about each group (though not its members).
