Schema Change
-------------
*WARNING:* This release contains schema changes.  To upgrade:
----
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
----

*WARNING:* Upgrading to 2.6.x requires the server be first upgraded to 2.1.7 (or
a later 2.1.x version), and then to 2.6.x.  If you are upgrading from 2.2.x.x or
newer, you may ignore this warning and upgrade directly to 2.6.x.

New Features
------------

Review UI
~~~~~~~~~
* The reviewer matrix on a change displays gray boxes where
  permissions do not allow voting in that category. The coloring
  enables authors to quickly identify if another reviewer is
  necessary to continue the change.

* New 'Rebase If Necessary' submit type. This is similar to cherry
  pick, but honors change dependency information.
* Submit type displayed per-change in the info block.
* Submit type selectable per-change by `submit_type` Prolog rules.

* The rebase button is hidden when the patch set is current.

* `suggest.from` configures a minimum number of characters before
  matches for reviewers, accounts, groups or projects are offered.

* A change's topic can be added, removed or changed from the
  change screen.

* A change's commit message can be edited from the change screen.


Access Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Remove Reviewer is a new permission.

* LDAP group names are configurable, `cn` is still the default.
* LDAP cache reduces the number of recursive group queries.
* Kerberos authentication to LDAP servers is now supported.

* Basic project properities are now inherited by default from parent
  projects: Use Content Merge, Require Contributor Agreement, Require
  Change Id, Require Signed Off By.

Hooks
~~~~~
* Change topic is passed to hooks as `--topic NAME`.
* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1200[Issue 1200]:
New `reviewer-added` hook and stream event when a reviewer is added.

SSH
~~~
* Descriptions are added to ssh commands.
+
If `gerrit` is called without arguments, it will now show a list of available
commands with their descriptions.

* `create-account --http-password` enables setting/resetting the
  HTTP password of role accounts, for Git or JSON API access.

* `ls-projects --has-acl-for` lists projects that mention a group
  in an ACL, identifying where rights are granted.

* `query` includes submit record information from Prolog rules.
* `query` includes `resumeSortKey` in summary block.
* `query` includes author and change size information when given
  certain options on the command line.

Plugins
~~~~~~~
* Plugins can contribute Prolog facts/predicates from Java.
* Plugins can prompt for parameters during `init` with `InitStep`.
* Plugins can now contribute JavaScript to the web UI. UI plugins can
  also be written and compiled with GWT.
* New Maven archetypes for JavaScript and GWT plugins.
* Plugins can contribute validation steps to received commits.
* Commit message length checks are moved to the `commit-message-length-validator`
  plugin which is included as a core plugin in the Gerrit distribution and
  can be installed during site initialization.

EMail
~~~~~
* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1531[Issue 1531]:
Email footers now include `Gerrit-HasComments: {Yes|No}`.
* Notifications configured in project.config can now be addressed
  using any of To, CC, or BCC headers.

* `#if($email.hasInlineComments())` can be used in templates to test
  if there are comments to be included in this email.

Upgrades
~~~~~~~~
* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1619[Issue 1619]:
Embedded Jetty is now 8.1.7.v20120910.

* ASM bytecode library is now 4.0.
* JGit is now 2.2.0.201212191850-r.

Bug Fixes
---------

Web UI
~~~~~~
* Links to CGit were broken when `remove-suffix` was enabled.

Git
~~~
* The wildcard `.` is now permitted in reference regex rules.
* Checking if a change is mergeable no longer writes to the repository.
* Improved `git ls-remote` and `git fetch` performance by caching
  changes, decreasing database queries and traffic.
* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1608[Issue 1608]:
Commits pushed without a Change-Id now warn with instructions on how
to download and install the commit-msg hook.

* Submitted but unmerged changes are periodically retried. This is
  necessary for a multi-master configuration where the second master
  may need to retry a change not yet merged by the first. Please note
  we still do not believe this is sufficient to enable multi-master.
