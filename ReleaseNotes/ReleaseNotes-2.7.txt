== New Features


=== General

* New `copyMaxScore` setting for labels.
+
Labels can be link:http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.7/config-labels.html#label_copyMaxScore[
configured] to copy approvals forward to the next patch set.

* Comment links can be link:http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.7/config-gerrit.html#commentlink[
defined per project in the project configuration].

* Gerrit administrators can define project-specific themes.
+
Themes can be link:http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.7/config-themes.html[
configured site-wide or per project].

* New '/a/tools' URL.
+
This allows users to download the `commit-msg` hook via the command line if the
Gerrit server requires authentication globally.

* New 'Stream Events' global capability.
+
The link:http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.7/access-control.html#capability_streamEvents[
Stream Events capability] controls access to the `stream-events` ssh command.
+
Only administrators and users having this capability are allowed to use `stream-events`.
+
If you are using the Gerrit Trigger Plugin in Jenkins, you must make sure that the
'Non-Interactive Users' group, or whichever group the Jenkins user belongs to, is
given the 'Stream Events' capability.

* Allow opening new changes on existing commits.
+
The `%base` argument can be used with `refs/for/` to identify a specific revision the server should
start to look for new commits at. Any commits in the range `$base..$tip` will be opened as a new
change, even if the commit already has another change on a different branch.

* New setting `gitweb.linkDrafts` to control if gitweb links are shown on drafts.
+
By default, Gerrit will show links to gitweb on all patch sets.  If the
link:http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.7/config-gerrit.html#gitweb.linkDrafts[
gitweb.linkDrafts setting] is set to 'false', links will not be shown on
draft patch sets.

* Allow changes to be automatically submitted on push.
+
Teams that want to use Gerrit's submit strategies to handle contention on busy
branches can use `%submit` to create a change and have it
link:http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.7/user-upload.html#auto_merge[
immediately submitted], if the caller has Submit permission on `refs/for/<ref>`.

* Allow administrators to see all groups.

is used as title.
