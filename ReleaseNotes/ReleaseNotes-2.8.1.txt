== Bug Fixes
* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2073[Issue 2073]:
Changes that depend on outdated patch sets were missing in the related changes list.
+
After rebasing the first change the other changes disappeared from the related changes list.

* Don't list the same change twice in related changes.

* Fix plugin API packaging.
+
Parts from JGit's signed library were included in the plugin API. As a consequence unit
tests were failing to execute against it.

* Fix IllegalArgumentException in task queue comparator.
+
This could happen if you have a long queue and the state of a task (DONE, CANCELLED,
RUNNING, READY, SLEEPING, OTHER) changes while the sorting is ongoing.

* Delegate to the filters for init and destroy phases in AllRequestFilter.
+
This fixes a bug that prevented javamelody from working properly.

* Fix ArrayOutOfBoundsException on initial commits.
+
This happened if a new patch set was given for an initial commit in a repository.

link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2360[Issue 2360]:
Enable syntax highlighting for CXX, HXX, Python, Go, Scala, BUCK and .gitmodules.

* Preserve SNAPSHOT suffix in Maven artifact names.
+
The SNAPSHOT suffix was being removed, which prevented Buck from
downloading the Gitblit plugin's custom artifacts from the Gerritforge
repository.

* Always show repo download command if repo download scheme is enabled.

* Minor fixes in the documentation.
