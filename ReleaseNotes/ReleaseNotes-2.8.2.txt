General
-------

* Only add "cherry picked from" when cherry picking a merged change.
+
The "(cherry picked from commit ...)" line was being added in the commit
message when cherry picking from closed changes, which included abandoned.

* Fix PUSH permission check for draft changes.
+
It was not possible to block pushes to the `refs/drafts` namespace.

* Don't allow project owners to create branches if create is blocked.
+
Project owners were able to create branches through the WebUI, REST and SSH
even when the 'create reference' permission was actually blocked for them.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2397[Issue 2397]:
Remove quotes and trailing period from "topic edited" messages.
+
The quotes and trailing period were causing linkification to fail for topics
that were set to a URL.

* Check if user can read HEAD commit when resolving detached HEAD.
+
If HEAD was detached the `GetHead` REST endpoint refused to resolve HEAD
when the user was not a project owner.


Change Screen / Diff Screen
---------------------------


* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2398[Issue 2398]:
Enable syntax highlighting for Groovy, Clojure, Lisp, Ruby and Perl.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2416[Issue 2416]:
Fix copy functionality in Firefox and Safari.
+
Ctrl-C/Cmd-C was activating the 'insert comment' feature, and preventing the
browser from copying the selected text to the clipboard.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2428[Issue 2428]:
Fix truncation of long lines in side-by-side diff.
+
Lines whose length exceeded the width of the window were being truncated
and only shown fully after zooming out/in on the browser.

* Fix handling of the enter key when editing the topic.
+
The enter key was causing the file diff view to open, instead of confirming
the topic edit.

* Fix wrong button being passed to the 'revert' action.
+
The action was using the cherry-pick button instead of the revert button.


ssh
---


* Support for nio2 backend is removed.
+
The nio2 backend is link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-252[
broken in MINA SSHD].  Support is removed until the next release of MINA
SSHD in which it is fixed.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2424[Issue 2424]:
Add descriptions on commands that are disabled in slave mode.
+
Commands that are disabled on a server running in slave mode were being listed
with an empty description.

* Remove obsolete commands from slave mode commands list.
+
The `approve` and `replicate` commands, which no longer exist, were still being
listed in the available commands shown when running the ssh `gerrit` command
without any arguments on a server running in slave mode.

* Remove 'including replication' from the `show-queue` command description.
+
The `replication` command is provided by the replication plugin, so it is no
longer relevant to mention this in the description of a core command.


Replication Plugin
------------------


* Never replicate automerge-cache commits.
+
Commits in the `automerge-cache` namespace are used on the master to
improve performance of the diff UI.  They are not needed on remote
mirrors and it is wasteful to replicate them.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2420[Issue 2420]:
Fix failure to create to missing remote repository via git:// protocol.
+
When replicating to a mirror over the anonymous git:// protocol and the
repository did not exist on the remote (i.e. if the remote was offline
when the repository was originally created), the replication failed with
a "remote repository error", rather than the expected "no repository".

* Improve info logging related to repository creation and deletion, and
differentiate between local and remote repository errors.

* Update documentation to clarify replication of refs/meta/config when
refspec is 'all refs'


Documentation
-------------


* Add missing documentation of the secondary index configuration.
+
Document that open and closed changes are indexed in separate indexes,
and for Lucene indexes the RAM buffer size and maximum buffered documents
can be configured.
    
* Correct the Gerrit download link.
+
The link on the documentation index was pointing to the Google Code page,
which has not been used for some time.

* Correct the description of the `revisions` field in the REST API's
`ChangeInfo` entity.

* Add a link from the plugin documentation to the validation listeners API
documentation.
