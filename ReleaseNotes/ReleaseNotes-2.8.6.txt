Fix race condition in change merge queue when using Cherry-Pick submit
strategy.
+
There was a race in the merge queue between changes submitted via
the UI, and merges scheduled by the background merge queue reload.
+
This resulted in multiple submit actions being scheduled, leading
to corrupt changes.
+
Execute cherry-pick submit DML operations in a database transaction
boundaries. In combination with implemented transaction management
for Jdbc dialects it solves the problem recovering from collisions
between interactive actions and background jobs.

* In gwtorm the LIMIT clause was only honored when followed by a
constant integer.
+
When followed by a placeholder "?" it wasn't included in the generated database
query. This caused poor performance when moving to the next change page for very
big projects.

* Fix sporadic SSHD handshake failures
(link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-330[SSHD-330]).

Updates
-------

* gwtorm is updated to 1.7.1
* sshd is updated to 0.11.1-atlassian-1
