Fix race condition in change merge queue.
+
There was a race in the merge queue between changes submitted via
the UI, and merges scheduled by the background merge queue reload.
+
This resulted in multiple submit actions being scheduled, leading
to corrupt changes.
+
Also implements transaction management for Jdbc dialects to recover
from collisions between interactive actions and background jobs.

* The LIMIT clause was only honored when followed by a constant integer.
When followed by a placeholder "?" it wasn't included in the generated
database query.
