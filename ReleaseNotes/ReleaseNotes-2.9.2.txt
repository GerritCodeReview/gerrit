*WARNING:* There are no schema changes from
link:ReleaseNotes-2.9.1.html[2.9.1], but when upgrading from an existing site
that was initialised with Gerrit version 2.6 or later the primary key column
order will be updated for some tables. It is therefore important to upgrade the
site with the init program, rather than only copying the .war file over the
existing one.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Update SSHD to 0.13.0.
+
This fixes link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-348[SSHD-348] which
was causing ssh threads allocated to stream-events clients to get stuck.
+
Also update SSHD Mina to 2.0.8 and Bouncycastle to 1.51.

Replication plugin: Prevent creating repos on extra servers.
+
If using a group to replicate only certain repositories, it was possible
to be in a state where the authGroup is used on some servers but not
others.  If this happened, Gerrit would create the repository on all
servers, even if the authGroup would prevent replicating code to it.
By ensuring the authGroup can see the project first, the repository is
not created if it's not needed.

* Update gwtorm to 1.14.
+
The primary key column order for compound keys was wrong for some Gerrit
database tables. This caused poor performance for those SQL queries which rely
on using a prefix of the primary key column sequence in their WHERE conditions.
+
This version of gwtorm fixes the issue for new sites. For existing sites that
were initialised with Gerrit version 2.6 or later, the primary key column
order will be fixed during initialisation when upgrading to 2.9.2.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2964[Issue 2964]:
Fix comment box font colors of dark CM themes.
+
When using a dark-colored theme, for example "Twilight", the comments were
shown in a light color on a light background making them unreadable.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2911[Issue 2911]:
Fix Null Pointer Exception after a MergeValidationListener throws
MergeValidationException.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2918[Issue 2918]:
Fix placement of margin column in side-by-side diff.

* Fix infinite loop when checking group membership.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2989[Issue 2989]:
Fix incorrect submodule subscriptions.
+
The gitlinks update failed after deleting a branch in a super project which had
other branches subscribed to the same submodule branch.

* Fix incorrect diff between patchsets.
+
In some cases the list of files between patchsets was not shown correctly.

* Fix "400 cannot create query for index" error in "Conflicts With" list.
+
The
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.9.2/config-gerrit.html#index.defaultMaxClauseCount[
index.defaultMaxClauseCount] setting allows to increase the BooleanQuery limit
for the Lucene index.
+
Raising the limit avoids failing a query with `BooleanQuery.TooManyClauses`,
preventing users from seeing a "400 cannot create query for index" error
in the "Conflicts With" section of the change screen.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2996[Issue 2996]:
Delete a change from the index if it is not in the database.
+
If for some reason the secondary index is out of date, i.e. a change was deleted
from the database but wasn't deleted from the secondary index, it was impossible
to re-index (remove) that change.
+
Automatically remove the change from the secondary index if it doesn't exist in
the database; if a user clicks on search result from a stale change, he will a
get a 404 page and the change will be removed from the index.
