Bug Fixes
---------

* Update SSHD to 0.13.0.
+
This fixes link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-348[SSHD-348] which
was causing ssh threads allocated to stream-events clients to get stuck.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2964[Issue 2964]:
Fix comment box font colors of dark CM themes.
+
When using a dark-colored theme, for example "Twilight", the comments were
shown in a light color on a light background making them unreadable.

* link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2911[Issue 2911]:
Fix Null Pointer Exception after a MergeValidationListener throws
MergeValidationException.

* Fix infinite loop when checking group membership.

* Fix incorrect submodule subscriptions.
+
The gitlinks update failed after deleting a branch in a super project which had
other branches subscribed to the same submodule branch.

* Fix incorrect diff between patchsets.
+
In some cases the list of files between patchsets was not shown correctly.

* Fix "400 cannot create query for index" error in "Conflicts With" list.
+
The
link:https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.9.2/config-gerrit.html#index.defaultMaxClauseCount[
index.defaultMaxClauseCount] setting allows to increase the BooleanQuery limit
for the Lucene index.
+
Raising the limit avoids failing a query with `BooleanQuery.TooManyClauses`,
preventing users from seeing a "400 cannot create query for index" error
in the "Conflicts With" section of the change screen.
