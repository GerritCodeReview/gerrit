Important Notes
---------------

*WARNING:* There are no schema changes from
link:ReleaseNotes-2.9.4.html[2.9.4], but when upgrading from an existing site
that was initialized with Gerrit version 2.6 to version 2.9.1 the primary key
column order will be updated for some tables. It is therefore important to
upgrade the site with the `init` program, rather than only copying the .war file
over the existing one.

It is recommended to run the `init` program in interactive mode. Warnings will
be suppressed in batch mode.

Bug Fixes

* [Issue 10262](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10262) Update JGit to 4.5.5.201812240535-r
+
This JGit fix validation of wants in git-upload-pack for protocol v0 stateless transports.
AdvertiseRefsHook was not called for git-upload-pack in protocol v0 stateless transports,
meaning that wants were not validated and a user could fetch anything that is pointed to
by any ref (using fetch-by-sha1), as long as they could guess the object name.
