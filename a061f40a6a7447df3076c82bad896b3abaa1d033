      "message": "Yes, the valid names are branch names. I am not sure if it would make sense to apply subscribe a superproject/branch to a submodule/tag, since tag does not move.\n\nSince when Shawn was reviewing it there was no disagreement about the term \"revision\", as far as I know. In the past he even talked about not considering tags to subscription with automatic update. Anyway, the term definition is something I was not involved when defined :-( \n\nConsidering all the existing implementation, unit tests, reviews, discussions (Ulrik even provided a wiki page on kernel.org in the past about this feature), I think \u0027revision\u0027 should continue as the name used. However, if you and the other reviewers really think it should change, I can try to modify it.",
