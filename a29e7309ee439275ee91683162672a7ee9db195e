      "message": "TBH I don\u0027t think streams are improving readability here. It\u0027s not obvious unless you really squint at the .filter(...) calls that these 3 lists form non-overlapping subsets of all elements in the input commands. If you do it iteratively:\n\n for (ReceiveCommand c : commands) {\n   if (isMagicBranch(c.getRefName()) {\n     magicCommands.add(c);\n   } else if (isDirectChangesPush(c)) {\n     directChangePushCommands.add(c);\n   } else {\n     otherCommands.add(c);\n   }\n }\n\nthen it\u0027s more obvious that every command gets added to exactly one of the 3 result lists.",
