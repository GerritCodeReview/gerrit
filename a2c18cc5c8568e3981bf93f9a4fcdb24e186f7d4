      "message": "I just realized this is not sufficient: removing a reviewer can affect the list of needed labels (in an arbitrary way via submit rules).\n\nThe way this used to work is removeReviewer returned the full, updated ChangeDetail (in the ReviewerResult). This is impossible in the REST API currently because DELETE returns 204 with no content.\n\nOptions are:\n\n1. The RFC allows returning a 200 with \"an entity describing the status\", which could just be the whole ChangeInfo again.\n\n2. Make a second RPC to refresh the table after the delete succeeds. This could result in a visible lag between removing the reviewer and the label list changing.\n\nWe will have a similar problem when PUTting a new reviewer.",
