      "message": "can be very helpful to have some JSDoc here explaining the changes compared to `Gerrit.css` as now its a two steps process:\n1. `new GrSharedStyle()` to create an instance with the styles\n2. use `instance.apply(element)` to apply the css to any element you want to apply the css on.\n\nafter switching to `class` syntax, it should help a lot on the readability",

      "message": "are coverageStyle and emptyStyle only used in following two methods and are these two methods used only for these conditions ? if so, \ncan we pass the `displayCoverage` or the `raw css rule` down to `annotateRange` and `annotateLineNumner` instead ? so the css related part will just be inside of those two methods, and the emptyStyle seems can be just replaced with `do nothing`. (will make the usage of this GrSharedStyle much clear as well).",
