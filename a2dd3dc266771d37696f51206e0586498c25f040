I misunderstood the first question and tried to relate it with this change.\n\nWell it is tied a bit, since this change assumes same name is same thing, but yeah, I see the confusion. I\u0027ll try to be clearer upfront next time 😊\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e If I manually create a SR with the same name as a label function will the SR override the label function?\n\u003e \n\u003e Yes and no.

If they did though, this change would miss migrating the legacy-submit-rule-label to a SR, correct?\n\nMaybe we could mitigate that by adding a dry-run/report mode that doesn\u0027t change anything but tells the user what would change and if any duplicate names were found?\n\n\u003e \n\u003e [1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/b3ee73ea8dab65ea0041a5409608087d9c036c96/java/com/google/gerrit/server/project/SubmitRequirementsUtil.java#58",
