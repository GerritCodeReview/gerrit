It means if we do\n\n DELETE /changes/X/edit/path\n\nfollowed by\n\n GET /changes/X/edit/path\n\nwe will get back the original contents, not a 204?\n\nAlso I believe this branch is not covered in the tests.",

      "message": "| This seems wrong\n\nThis is subtle and I can see how this code may looks confusing, and I should probably put a comment here. Let me try to explain why i think it is correct. With change edit feature we are supporting five different modification operations:\n\n* 1. modify file contained in the edit\n* 2. modify file not contained yet in the edit\n* 3. restore file\n* 4. delete file\n* 5. add new file (not contained in the repository)\n\nTo implement first two use cases, we need to retrieve the content of the file.\n\nCase 1. is the content from the edit itself, that is the lines 268-271 above. Case 2. the file is not in edit yet, and here we have a fallback to the lines where you put this comment. From the file table code pointe of view, it as easy as to say:\n\n   private static RestApi contentEdit(Change.Id id, String filename) {\n    return ChangeApi.edit(id.get()).id(filename);\n  }\n\nDone. And because we try to avoid to propagate the knowledge of base patch set to change edit consumer code (FileTable) the only viable alternative here would be to differentiate between get file from edit/get file from revision, and we would end up from the edit to start fire revision specific requests:\n\n* get content from edit: GET /changes/\u003cid\u003e/edit/path\n* get content from revision: GET /changes/\u003cid\u003e/revisions/\u003cid\u003e/files/oath/content\n\nSo my answer is let\u0027s server code to do the right job, instead of making client more complex and to avoid to require to propagate base patch set number the edit is based on to the client code.",
