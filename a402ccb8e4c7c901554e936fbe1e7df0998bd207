      "message": "Gerrit Daemon depends on it and /gerrit-gpg is also wasn\u0027t included in plugin-api (you may argue, it should be included in the plugin-api). I think it wasn\u0027t included in the plugin-api for a reason, but because Daemon wouldn\u0027t start without it, it must be included at least in acceptance-framework. Note, it would be a trivial change to move stuff from acceptance-framework to plugin-api, though.",
