      "message": "I thought there was a checkbox \"Rebase on behalf of uploader\".\n\nWhat happened to this checkbox?\nI don\u0027t see it on this change. (https://imgur.com/a/vtA3ADO)\n\nIs this WAI? Am I missing some condition to see it or has that been removed? I don\u0027t see it here as well. (https://imgur.com/a/BESgYBp).\n\nOverall I am a bit confused with the user experience here.\n\n\u003e When a user is not the latest uploader\n\nThis is how the commit message starts. So I am assume someone who is not the latest uploader wants to rebase the change but not become the new uploader?\n\nThis seems like the core issue Change 361355 was supposed to address?",
