      "message": "Maybe I should add that we tried to change the favicons once for an internal developer tool, and we all thought \"hey, easy, simple change\", but it turned to be the most controversial change that we did in years with lots of (negative) user feedback. So we have gotten extremely cautious about \"just changing the favicon\". :-)",

See the bug, users widely agree.\n\nMy take:  Don\u0027t spend effort making it a setting.  Just make it the default behavior.  Simpler.  Easier to maintain.  Does what people want.  Matches Cider.",

      "message": "I am not so sure whether all users really want this feature.\n\nCritique is different in two fundamental ways:\n\n1. The color coding of CL status is much more prominent.\n2. Critique automatically updates the CL status.\n\nCider is different, because it uses color coding for build/test status, which is a different workflow.\n\nI would like to understand better what the benefit is of color coding the favicons. Maybe you can explain some scenarios where color coded favicons increase your productivity.\n\nI could see this being useful for telling you about:\n1. A change was submitted.\n2. Builds/Tests have failed.\n3. You were added to the attention set (this is a new feature, currently in dogfood phase).\n\nThe prerequisite for each of these is that the Gerrit UI gets information about that state change pushed (or polls for it). That is currently not the case.\n\nYou also have to consider browser notifications, which might be a better means of telling the user.\n\nI don\u0027t see a use case for \"abandoned\" and \"private\".",

      "message": "Right now, all Critique tabs are a favicon showing a green box with a green checkmark within.\n\nThis is misleading.  Most of those are not LGTM+Approved changes waiting for submission.\n\nThey contain a mix of submitted CLs, work in progress, things I\u0027m waiting for others on, things needing my attention.\n\nHighlighting the attention set and submitted status would be useful.  Attention set should include things like \"Submit was clicked, but the submit automation failed so you need to come back and look at it\".  I wouldn\u0027t differentiate presubmit/build/tests failed vs other forms of attention.\n\nI don\u0027t know how feasible it is for Chrome tab favicons to communicate this reliably.  At some point, tabs open too long, perhaps across a chrome restart, become idle and aren\u0027t actively loaded or run by Chrome until selected.  But even if the live status can\u0027t be kept up to date, differentiating between the status at the time it was last loaded would be helpful.\n\neven just a binary submitted vs not submitted would be helpful.  (grey for submitted?)\n\nI intentionally have submitted CL tabs open for reference and investigation intermixed with active CLs.  It\u0027d help visually differentiate those so I can more readily find what I need.  Assume a tab bar is full and icons-only.  There is never room for text up there.",
