I.e. is it feasible to create a new patch set with the resulting merge commit\u0027s sha1, like with new commits created by the cherry-pick and rebase-if-necessary strategies?",

      "message": "That makes sense in my opinion as it would result in cleaner history and would allow for tracing commits back to review regardless the submit-type policy... but I guess that in order to make it default behaviour one would prefer to have https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/72092/ merged so at least one could view what merge commit looks like.\nDave, Edwin - what are your thoughts about it?",
