The sequence might look like ..\n\n* Saving 1 draft...\n* Saving 2 drafts...\n* Saving 1 draft...\n* All changes saved\n\nIs the number the part that seems over-engineered?\n\nThe goal of these tooltips is to encourage users to freely make many drafts while navigating around. Maybe on a really slow API day a user might wait on 10 drafts to be saved.\n\n* Saving 10 drafts...\n* Saving 9 drafts...\n* ...\n\nWithout a number like this in the toast, it\u0027d be hard to tell whether progress is being made.",

I guess it\u0027s part of a larger problem I personally have, namely not knowing where the line is between \"building an excellent product\" and \"writing more code than you really need to\".\n\nThat being said, I just tried it out and it\u0027s pretty neat, and is already written and tested :D",
