      "message": "I took this simple approach for some internal code because I wanted a solution now, and I was not willing to potentially break our production environment.  But if people think we should just start enforcing that refs start with \"refs/\" in the Branch.NameKey setter, I will push a change to do that since it is a better long term solution.  I just don\u0027t know how much of our code might break in that case.  Hopefully it won\u0027t actually break anything.  I suspect that everything will just work if we start enforcing this because if a branch gets stored in the db on a change in short form (without the leading \"refs/\"), it generally breaks that change today.  So at least with respect to changes, enforcing it isn\u0027t likely going to break anything.",
