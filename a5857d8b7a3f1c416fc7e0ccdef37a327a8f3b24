      "message": "I\u0027m not sure if we should support direct migration from versions as old as 2.6, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s unreasonable to go from 2.14 to 2.16. It seems a few people want to do that, hence it\u0027s been reported as an issue on the mailing list a couple of times. As far as I can see, the broken 150 to 151 migration is the only one that blocks it.\n\nAlso for our (Collabnet) customers, we have a lot of them on 2.14 and it\u0027s difficult, if not impossible, to mandate them to do a two stage upgrade if they want to go to 2.16.",
