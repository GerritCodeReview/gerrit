      "message": "I would prefer to not have the dialog depend on GrComment. Can we somehow avoid that?\n\nAn option could be to just put \"state: unknown\" into the event, because the dialog is not really interested in what this contains, but just passes it back in the close event.\n\nBut maybe then a callback approach is better? If the `OpenFixPreviewEvent` gets a `onCloseCallback`, then maybe we don\u0027t even need a `CloseFixPreviewEvent` at all? `fireReload()` is something that the initiator of the `OpenFixPreviewEvent` can do. That does not have to be done by change-view.\n\nWDYT?",
