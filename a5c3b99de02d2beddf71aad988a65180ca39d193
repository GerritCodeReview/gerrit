      "message": "Currently, we have the concept of submit_filter which is a mean for parent project(s) to enforce\n(some) submit rules on child projects. submit_filter it is actually not inheritance of submit rules.\nInstead, submit_filter from parent project transforms the result of the submit_rule from a child project.\n\nI am not sure if you considered submit filters at all and if what you are writing here\nis neutral to the concept of submit filters or intended to be a replacement for them?\n\nIMHO, the concept of submit filter is a core feature. They are implemented in Prolog\nbut they are a core concept.\n\nWe have users who use a submit filter on a common parent project to enforce mandatory\nsubmit-ability conditions on a set of child projects. Child projects can still define\nown submit rules but they cannot escape the (enforced) rules form parent project(s).\n\nIMHO, we should be able to define submit filter on a (parent) project using any plugin(s)\nwhich provides submit filters, independently on which plugins are used to implement\nsubmit rules on child projects.",
