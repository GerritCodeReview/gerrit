      "message": "\u003e I am a bit puzzled by this change: shouldn\u0027t be something internal to the elasticsearch implementation? Why Gerrit has to know about it?\n\nGerrit knows if we\u0027re operating online or offline and should have a means for adjusting policy for index consistency in each. That\u0027s generic to indexing and not specific to one index implementation.\n\n\u003e I think it should be an optional even for ES and enabled in Gerrit but disabled during the offline re-indexing, as the consistency doesn\u0027t really matter.\n\nFor us, we want strong consistency in online mode. However, this change opens the possibility of adding a config in ES that sets it to false so that you could adjust the behavior to be what you want.\n\u003e \n\u003e I assume there is a significant performance improvement for offline reindexing?\n\nYes, it\u0027s huge. We can add the perf stat to https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/modules/index-elasticsearch/+/339115 but it probably doesn\u0027t make sense here.",

I can\u0027t recall the reference he shared on it, but it shows up in Clean Code [1]. booleans are not self-documenting, so it\u0027s better to use a class with a name. It also allows for a future with more than 2 allowed values (not sure if that exists for this case, but we\u0027re safe just in case).\n\n[1] https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p\u003d1392524",
