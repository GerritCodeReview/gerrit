I count 7 /revisions requests to serve the change screen; we can\u0027t be doing this ETag computation for every single one of them, when the only one that we actually care about is /revisions/X/actions.\n\nIt\u0027s possible (read: likely) that the REST API glue only knows how to handle HasETag on a RestResource, not on a RestReadView. We need to fix that.",
