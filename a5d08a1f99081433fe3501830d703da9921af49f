      "message": "I\u0027m a bit confused by this change. The threaded feedback design is already implemented. During the implementation, we decided to use the name \"patchset-level\" as it turned out that change messages are always associated with a patchset. Hence, the natural mapping was \"change messages\" -\u003e \"patchset-level\" comments. Patchset-level comments are fully implemented and supported in Gerrit. I\u0027m in fact even using such a patchset-level comment for writing this comment right now.\n\nJacek, can you please elaborate what the intention of this change is given that we already have patchset-level comments?",

      "message": "Ups... it seems that I have missed it somehow ;)\nAnyway I was under impression that patchset comments are not exactly the same as they are VISUALLY bound to the particular ps (in my proposal \u0027/CHANGE_LEVEL\u0027 comments are not ;)) not necessarily relating to the whole change.\nIn addition when one replies (through the main \u0027Reply\u0027 button not through any \u0027reply\u0027 link) feedback is posted as regular message which is not thread\u0027able unless feature flag \u0027UiFeature__patchset_comments\u0027 is used (at least this is what see in my locally built master). To sum it up: have noticed patchset comments but was rather under impression that they are exactly what the feature is about...",
