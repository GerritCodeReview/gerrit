      "message": "I\u0027m a bit confused by this change. The threaded feedback design is already implemented. During the implementation, we decided to use the name \"patchset-level\" as it turned out that change messages are always associated with a patchset. Hence, the natural mapping was \"change messages\" -\u003e \"patchset-level\" comments. Patchset-level comments are fully implemented and supported in Gerrit. I\u0027m in fact even using such a patchset-level comment for writing this comment right now.\n\nJacek, can you please elaborate what the intention of this change is given that we already have patchset-level comments?",
