You want to replace existing gr-message-list with this experimental version in the future?\n\nIf (1) - I am Ok with this change\nIf (2) - I am afraid that people will forget to update it and port important fixes here.\nFor example, in https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/263694/1 tests are not ported and\nI don\u0027t know was it intended or you just forgot to port.\n\nIn the case (2) may be it is better to rename old version (i.e. gr-messages-list -\u003e gr-messages-list-deprecated) and keep original name for the experimental version",
