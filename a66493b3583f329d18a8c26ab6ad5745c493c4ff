      "message": "Also basically immaterial to the change, but I don\u0027t really like this kind of formatting for function call chaining. In the same way we don\u0027t put each arg to a function on its own line, do we really need to put the call to reload on its own line? I think it\u0027s just as readable, and I value my vertical space.\n\nFeel free to ignore me though.",
