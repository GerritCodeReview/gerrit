I would prefer a change that:\n\n- tries to run baselisk first\n- if that fails, emits a warning and tries to run bazel as a fallback (current behaviour)\n- emits a \u0027nice\u0027 error if also bazel fails to run, then suggests to install bazel + bazelisk.\n- include this preference for bazelisk \u0026 fallback in the \u0027--help\u0027 output.",
