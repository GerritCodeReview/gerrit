      "message": "Now that the concept of NORMAL as separate from CREATE/REPLACE/CLOSE has been defined, I think it makes sense to avoid incrementing this metric for NORMAL-type pushes.\n\nI know it\u0027s a bit asymmetric, but given that it\u0027s impossible to \"subtract\" data from a histogram I think it\u0027s more useful that way. I imagine plotting this alongside the latency per change and the latency per push to see a pattern in whether the number of changes per push suddenly changed et cetera. The signal is much clearer if it isn\u0027t muddied by the 99% (which are NORMAL pushes).\n\nIf you agree, the description of the \"changes\" metric would need to be amended to state that it no longer contains NORMAL pushes.",
