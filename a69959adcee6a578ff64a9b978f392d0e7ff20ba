      "message": "There definitely seem to be .txt files containing what look like Java classes in subdirectories of this. e.g. hardware/interfaces/audio/4.0/config/api/current.txt\n\nThey seem to be created by xsd_config so presumably they are not Java APIs per se but might still be worth reviewing anyway if they are externally visible.\n\nGiven that xsd_config generates files that look identical to Java APIs would it be worth doing something to xsd_config to differentiate its output from Java APIs? e.g. Maybe having it create a special NO_API_REVIEW_REQUIRED file which could be used instead of this whitelist? That way any new usages of xsd_config would not need to be added here. If some of them needed API review and others did not then that could be controlled by a new xsd_config property.\n\nAs long as the addition/removal of the special file still required API review you would get similar protections to what you get here. The special file\u0027s presence alone would be enough to prevent API review but it could contain an explanation as to why, e.g. generated by xsd_config.\n\nThe downside is that it would require more work to update the files and would only be ignored in branches where the file exists. But then again changes to inactive branches would be unlikely anyway.",
