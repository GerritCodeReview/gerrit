      "message": "That\u0027s a good point. I agree that for the account suggestion (and also for the reviewer suggestion, but that\u0027s a different REST endpoint) we just want to pass the query string to the defaultField.\n\nOn the other hand I think it\u0027s beneficial to support generic account queries via REST (e.g. for tool integration). The \"right\" REST endpoint for this would be\n\n  GET /accounts/?q\u003d\u003cquery\u003e\n\nbecause this is consistent with how change queries are exposed via REST. Unfortunately \u0027GET /accounts/?q\u003d\u003cquery\u003e\u0027 is already occupied for the account suggestion.\n\nSo if we want to have separate REST endpoints for account suggestion and generic account queries, which I agree makes sense, then we must find a good endpoint for the generic account queries:\n\n  GET /accounts/query?q\u003d\u003cquery\u003e\n\n?",

      "message": "Oh, I didn\u0027t actually realize account suggestion and reviewer suggestion were separate endpoints. Where is account suggestion used? Group admin pages?\n\nI think I would prefer if /accounts/?q\u003d actually supports the full account syntax, and we just introduce a different endpoint, say /accounts/suggest?q\u003d for the defaultField-based account suggestion. The UI would switch to the new endpoint. The only backwards incompatibility in the old endpoint is if the input looks like a field:value, which was not supported before but is now. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s so terrible.",
