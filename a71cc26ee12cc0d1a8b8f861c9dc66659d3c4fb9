But the previous change which removes the support for ES also adds an annotation to the LuceneIndexModule [1].\nThat annotation name is the same as this type name, which is a bit hard to follow. Maybe use different names?\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/323676/15/java/com/google/gerrit/lucene/LuceneIndexModule.java",
