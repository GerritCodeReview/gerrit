      "message": "Valid point, David. For the current purpose and in my understanding, though, the knowledge of capabilities is not required for low-level tasks such as rate limiting (being my intention), where the mere knowledge of the user\u0027s identity is required. Otherwise, an early request to find the not yet established user leads to the user being declared \"anonymous\" and a bunch of troubles. I might not have the full picture, maybe Sasa or you can comment.",

Gerrit UI request: when authenticated user session is found and set in RequestContextFilter, before AllRequestFilter, that\u0027s why in AllRequestFilter we have a user. Example: in plugin implemented AllRequestFilter with this code: [2], that produces this output:\n\n  Account: 1000000 username: admin\n\n* 2. REST API request: e.g.:\n\n  $ curl --user admin:secret http://localhost:8080/a/config/server/version\n  \"2.14.7-9-g9ebfce95b7-dirty\"\n\nHere the AllRequestFilter is bound before GitOverHttpModule, that provides ProjectBasicAuthFilter filter, and thus, as you said, there is no identified user, the code in: [2] produces: by the request above:\n\n  anonymous\n\nSo what this series is trying to achive is to bind AllRequestfilter *after* GitOverHttpModule.\n\nInstead of splitting AllRequestFilter in two, by preserving the old one and split of new AllAuthenticatedRequestFilter, what id we just change the semantic of the old AllRequestFilter that is run after ProjectBasicAuthFilter?\n\nSo the much less intrusive change that do what the whol series is doing, is to change these two lines: [3].\n\nWith this two lines changed, running:\n\n  $ curl --user admin:secret http://localhost:8080/a/config/server/version\n\nproduces, would give you the user as expected:\n\n  Account: 1000000 username: admin\n\nThe better question, what would we lose with those two lines? In any event, the commit message should mention the dispatch order of guice filter binding and reflect on that considered alternative: to re-order AllRequestFilter to be bound after the ProjectBasicAuthFilter.\n\n\n* [1] https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/ServletModule#dispatch-order\n* [2] http://paste.openstack.org/show/705126\n* [3] http://paste.openstack.org/show/705146",
