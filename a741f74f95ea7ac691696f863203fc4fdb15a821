      "message": "Currently this test works because events are being fired synchronously. I did not want to rely on sync behavior for the other scenarios above - reason why I expected everything using event listener + done.\n\nI think it can be risky to return a boolean for createCommentInPlace as this would implicitly assume all behavior of creating comments is synchronous. Since part of the actual behavior resides in eventListeners and relies on events being fired, I find this assumption to be potentially risky. I would not want to return \"true\" for createCommentsInPlace when this actually failed in some async eventListener.\n\nHowever, checking that something is *not* called inside a potentially async process is hard - I would need timers and stuff.\n\nI took the direction of using partial mocks (as the rest of the code in this file).
