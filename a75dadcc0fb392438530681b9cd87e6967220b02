      "message": "I\u0027m afraid that pushing the previous history to the server will not work right away after creating the project, but one first needs to set the access rights accordingly (allow direct push to master bypassing code review). For a Gerrit beginner (which is the target audience for this doc) this would not be obvious and therefore I think it should be mentioned. Alternatively I would be fine with just describing the straight-forward case of creating a test project without describing in this document how to import an existing project.",

      "message": "Would be feasible, but if you want to push from another machine to the Gerrit server with bypassing Gerrit then you need to have an SSH deamon running on the Gerrit server (assuming you want to push over SSH). For this to work you first have to setup everything for SSH (e.g. make your public key available). So I think this would be even more difficult to describe and it would be confusing because it\u0027s not the normal way how to work with Gerrit.\n\nSo I would vote for going the easy way and just limit this descrition to the creation of a test project and not to describe how to import an existing project. If this is needed, it can still be added later.",
