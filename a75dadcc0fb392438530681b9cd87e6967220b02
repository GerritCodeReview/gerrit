      "message": "I\u0027m afraid that pushing the previous history to the server will not work right away after creating the project, but one first needs to set the access rights accordingly (allow direct push to master bypassing code review). For a Gerrit beginner (which is the target audience for this doc) this would not be obvious and therefore I think it should be mentioned. Alternatively I would be fine with just describing the straight-forward case of creating a test project without describing in this document how to import an existing project.",

      "message": "Would be feasible, but if you want to push from another machine to the Gerrit server with bypassing Gerrit then you need to have an SSH deamon running on the Gerrit server (assuming you want to push over SSH). For this to work you first have to setup everything for SSH (e.g. make your public key available). So I think this would be even more difficult to describe and it would be confusing because it\u0027s not the normal way how to work with Gerrit.\n\nSo I would vote for going the easy way and just limit this descrition to the creation of a test project and not to describe how to import an existing project. If this is needed, it can still be added later.",

      "message": "Actually, if you are able to set up the Gerrit service, I think we must assume you already have access to a server, either by SSH or by VNC/console. Since you have such access, it should be easy to instruct the user to download/clone the git to their server, and then push it locally to the location of the git serviced. No new SSH service will be required, and keep in mind that the vast majority of the *nix-servers already have sshd running.\nThat is an easy enough solution I think, because the user would have to clone or keep it somewhere on their own client to even work with it, so that should be \"preassumed knowledge\" more or less. And it\u0027d be a guide about quite a lot more than gerrit if we can\u0027t assume such knowledge. Can I tweak the current text with the above information?\n\nIf there\u0027s any flaw to my reasoning, please tell me. I\u0027ll follow your advice to cut it if I can see that it isn\u0027t as obvious as I would like to make it look like.. :)",
