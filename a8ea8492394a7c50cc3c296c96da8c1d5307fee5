      "message": "The idea was to redefine the GroupMemberAuditListener interface in such a way that future adjustments (for instance further event types like \u0027renames\u0027) can be added without breaking implementations of GroupMemberAuditListener. Such a redefinition would naturally move away from the ReviewDb types. I would very much prefer that we address the redefinition of GroupMemberAuditListener first and avoid changing GroupMemberAuditListener again and again.",

      "message": "Further event types like \"renames\" could be a new method directly and thus will not affect existing methods? e.g.\n\nvoid onRenameGroups(Account.Id actor, String newName, Timestamp renamedOn);\n\nRefactoring like the current change is not good enough if in the future we want to add more properties thourgh the existing interfaces. But what do we want to add? \n\nIf we want to redesign this listener using new Event types, would we have the following new interfaces?\n1- GroupAddAccountsEvent\n2- GroupDeleteAccountsEvent\n3- GroupAddSubgroupsEvent\n4- GroupDeleteSubgroupsEvent\n\nThey will be used by the four methods we have now. In the furture, when we can add \"GroupRenameEvent\". By doing this, we don\u0027t need to change the interfaces, instead we can update these event types to update behaviors, which sounds good to me.\n\nDo I understand the idea you\u0027re expecting correctly?",
