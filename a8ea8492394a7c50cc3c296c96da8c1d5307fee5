      "message": "The idea was to redefine the GroupMemberAuditListener interface in such a way that future adjustments (for instance further event types like \u0027renames\u0027) can be added without breaking implementations of GroupMemberAuditListener. Such a redefinition would naturally move away from the ReviewDb types. I would very much prefer that we address the redefinition of GroupMemberAuditListener first and avoid changing GroupMemberAuditListener again and again.",
