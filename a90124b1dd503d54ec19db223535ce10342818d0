      "message": "We still need to remove the approval in notedb.\n\nIt\u0027s okay to not delete the PatchSetApproval when the database is used as backend, but with notedb we explicitly don\u0027t want to keep any dummy zero votes around. Instead notedb is explicitly keeping track of reviewers. Hence with notedb the user will stay a reviewer even when all the approvals are deleted.",

I think the LabelNormalizer should be left unchanged and the \"update to zero instead delete\" logic for DB has to be handled in this method.",
