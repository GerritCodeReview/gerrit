      "message": "Happy to help here :-)\n\nLooking at the submit whole topic doc [1] wording, there dependent is used in the strict sense of referring to ancestors of changes in the \"topic-set\". I think that\u0027s consistent with how most Gerrit users expect dependent to refer to git ancestry. In general, we don\u0027t seem to have a word in the docs to describe the ChangeSet concept that I see used in the code here. I think both dependent and related are inaccurate in this context (we typically use related to refer to changes with the same Change-Id across branches). We might want to add a term to the glossary and submission-related docs for change-set/(change-)submission-set (and maybe for topic-set too?).\n\nUntil we have better terms for this I think you need to be wordier and say something like \"Change $c.id must be submitted with change $cd.id but $c.id is not ready because $message\". It would probably also be good to check that all the exception messages from checkSubmitRequirements() flow into that \u0027because ...\u0027 nicely (they seem pretty close already, but a few tweaks could help).\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/cross-repository-changes.html#_topic_submission_behavior",
