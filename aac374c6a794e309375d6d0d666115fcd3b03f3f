      "message": "So, this change is on stable-2.16 branch. On this branch plugin-manager was not added as core plugin. So why is this needed now? As Luca pointed out, there is no other cross-core-plugin-dependencies. No core plugins depend on other core plugins. So we do it only to potentially test plugin-manager as non-core plugin?\n\nBut why I cannot add this required-projects section in ansible playbook recipe in plugin-manger itself?",
