We are happy to do them when there is a fix we as a community need or we have not done an upgrade for a longer time period. In this case, neither argument applies, so we can\u0027t spend more time on an upgrade right now, sorry. Happy to revisit this in 2021.",

Given Google\u0027s monorepo and Google\u0027s \"single version for every dependency\" strategy, this should be a no-op change for you, right?\n\n[1] https://github.com/google/error-prone/blob/797bbc65697341e2f58c14340203908c6325dad6/pom.xml#L41",
