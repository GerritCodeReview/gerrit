      "message": "It looks like the current testing for ssh commands is pretty simple and just checks that command --help output is as expected. Is there a good way to manipulate users and groups such that one group is subgroup of another and they have different membership lists so that ls-members --recursive output can be verified as being complete?\n\nI\u0027ll attempt to test this locally as well since its a bit easier for me to use our functional testing of Gerrit to check something like this than figure out how to manipulate Gerrit in that manner via the test framework.",
