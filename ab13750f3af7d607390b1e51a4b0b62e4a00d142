      "message": "This imitates the behavior of submitThisChange(), which has the check for a single change as:\n\n     List\u003cSubmitRecord\u003e submitRecords \u003d checkSubmitRule(cd,\n        rsrc.getPatchSet(), force);\n\nThe checkSubmitRule also just throws a ResourceConflictException if a label is missing. All the areChangesSubmittable is doing is having a loop around a bunch of changes and giving a textual return instead. \n\nSo I thought to have the same behavior as the single change commit, we want to also throw an exception here. So I would change that to ResourceConflictException instead of OrmRuntimeException. \n\nThis is in fact a precaution as the check if it is submittable should have been done before, when displaying the web UI or in the respective /detail or /actions REST API call. I only expect this exception to trigger, when you deliberately choose to call submit without checking if you are allowed to do so. And in that case a server throwing the hands up in the air, \"500!\" is totally fine?",
