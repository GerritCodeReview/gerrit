In the case where notedb.write \u003d true but RebuildNoteDb has not been run, the root commit for a change will have an arbitrary author and timestamp.\n\nI think we need to have an explicit method called create() or something that says to record all the immutable fields (changeKey, createdOn, owner, dest) in this commit.",
