      "message": "This is a significant behavior change, which was fortunately caught by our smoke tests.\n\nIf you do BLOCK refs/heads/foo, then allRefsAreVisible returns false. This even applies for project owners, so callers that depend on allRefsAreVisible to bypass refs filtering would see *false*, entering the filtering codepath.\n\nLater in this series you make allRefsAreVisible private, and encourage callers to convert to \"project(project).can(READ)\". But because of this \"|| isOwner()\" clause, callers that depend on can(READ) to bypass refs filtering will now see *true*, bypassing filtering.",
