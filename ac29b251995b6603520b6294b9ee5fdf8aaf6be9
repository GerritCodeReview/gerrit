      "message": "This is a behavioral change because internal queries used to have defaultLimit (10k) applied. Now we set INTEGER_MAX. For our index, this means we instruct it to return all changes.\n\nThis would break in at least one case in ChangesByProjectCacheImpl where we get a base set of changes to use for visibility filtering on the Git wire. Going from 10k to INT_MAX (\u003d 1M+ changes for some projects) would likely cause an outage.\n\nWould it make sense that we have a \"default internal limit\" and a \"default API limit\" and distinguish between these two?",
