It\u0027s an exception thrown from inside the dropwizard implementation.\n\nWhen a callBackMetric is created (L222 for example) it doesn\u0027t go through the path that includes the call to define(name, desc) which throws this:\n\n throw new IllegalStateException(String.format(\"metric \u0027%s\u0027 already defined\", name));\n\nand instead ends up failing with an exception thrown from inside the dropwizard implementation:\n\n A metric named queue/forwardcacheevictionevent/max_pool_size already exists\n\nThat\u0027s why at L213 the check is only for the string \"already\" rather than the full message, so that it works for both.\n\n\u003e should we add a method which does not fail if metric already exist and use that method here in the WorkQueue?\n\nThat would be a better solution, but I thought it would be too risky to mess around with the metrics implementation on the stable branch.",
