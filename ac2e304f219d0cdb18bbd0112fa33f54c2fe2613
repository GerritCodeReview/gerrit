The problem is when writing to both backends, NoteDb + DB. NoteDb is not having any placerholder approval, but one is created in the DB. Now when deleting a reviewer, we read the approvals to be deleted from NoteDb, but since they do not contain the placeholder approvals, those are not deleted from the DB.",
