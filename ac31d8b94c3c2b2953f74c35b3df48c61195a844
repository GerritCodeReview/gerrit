      "message": "Hello Sven: \n\nI am sorry for the confusion. I think the title of your commit message indicates that you were fixing the task name, however from the commit message body it looks like you were actually fixing the logs instead of task names because the \"loglines\" you were posting was actually the logs (from sshd_log file) and the original task name (from show-queue command) looked like this: \n\nTask     State        StartTime         Command\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQueue: SSH-Interactive-Worker\n3ce351ff              09:25:40.823      gerrit review--project pg3 --message GMDC Tests started: UPC_EBT_DUS52\nJob links:\n_LRATKI/9431\n d7d689a0c0 (eztaobo)\n\nthat\u0027s why I think there is a contradiction where the message title and message body talk about different things. Can you please let me know if I am right or wrong? Thank you.",

      "message": "The reverted commit fixes the task name. Before the patch this could be multi-line due to the --message arg.\n\nBut since taskName in TaskThunk#run is used to name the thread:\n\n    thisThread.setName(\"SSH \" + taskName);\n\nwe now have a multi-line thread name.\n\nThe \"log-line\" that I pasted in the commit message is actually _not_ from sshd_log, it\u0027s from error_log:\n[timestamp] [thread name] log-level class : message.\n\nI did not change anything but the thread name, so I don\u0027t see how that would affect the sshd_log (where the thread-name is not used) or the show-queue command that doesn\u0027t contain the thread-name either. It could be that I\u0027m missing something, if that is the case please enlighten me.\n\nThe information that my patch removed was useful in fringe cases. For instance if the add-reviewer workflow failed somewhere and the cause was an ill-formatted \"gerrit review\" command (don\u0027t even know if that\u0027s possible). You lost the immediate traceability between a log line in the error_log and the arguments of the \"gerrit review\" command, and I fail to see when the loss of that immediate connection would be fatal. You can always compare the timestamps in the sshd_log and at least narrow it down to 2-3 review commands that could have been the instigator. That being said I fail to see how that would ever be useful.",
