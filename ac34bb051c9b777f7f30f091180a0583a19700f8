The code that broke is is not on stable-2.15.\n\nI fixed it in the merge because there was a test, added on stable-2.15, that exposed the breakage when merged to master.  I then found a bunch of other cases, and fixed them separately in this commit on top of the merge.\n\nThen I realised that the merge might take some time to get in, due to other breakages related to the new WIP preferences, so I rebased this on the head of master and added the fix that was in the merge.",
