      "message": "fp[5] is upcast to int by sign extending and then shifted left only 16 bits. There are now very high bits set. Or not set depending on the sign-ness of fp[5].\n\nThe resulting hash is a mash of bits sure, but is not the same hash as ObjectId.\n\nBecause you use \u0026 fp[4] doesn\u0027t get to contribute anything unless fp[5] is negative.\n\n\nI would suggest just using NB.decodeInt32(fp, 4) here if that is what you want. Or use ByteBuffer.wrap(fp).getInt(4). Or write a correct conversion of 4 bytes into an int.",
