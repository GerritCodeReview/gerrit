      "message": "AFAIK, the order of bindings declaration in Guice modules doesn\u0027t matter. Before creating an injector all bindings are put into a flat list and Guice figures out the order of instantiations based on dependencies between classes.\n\nWhile your change fixes the issue, the explanation here is too broad.\nWe have that concept of LifecycleModule, in Gerrit\u0027s own extension to Guice, which has these:\n\n  listener().to(SomeClassImplementingLifecycleListener.class);\n\nand the start() methods of each such listener are executed in the order they are declared.\nYour change actually makes sure that PluginLoader.start() is executed before the LuceneIndexModule.start(), this is the main point here.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have explicit dependencies between LifecycleListeners, and when they\nare declared from different modules it is hard to see the order in which they are started.\nThis is a downside of using the LifecycleModule, IMHO.",

      "message": "I know, I could have put even more detail and the issue is the LifecycleListener that starts the modules in the same order they are registered with it (the listener().to() you mentioned).\n\nThe loading of the plugins are performed using Guice but their bindings are not made by the PluginModule itself but only by the PluginLoader which is started by the start() method invoked by the LifecycleListener.\n\nI will put a larger and more detailed comment as suggested.",

      "message": "The confusing part in this comment is that we are talking about plugin loading, but referencing PluginRestApi module. This is because PluginRestApiModule installs PluginModule, that is actually responsible for the plugin loading. Do you thing it would make it more clear, to decouple both modules, and put only PluginModule(), and preserve the old location of PluginRestApiModule?",
