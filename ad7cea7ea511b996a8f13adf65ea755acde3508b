      "message": "During documenting the new CS2 in this change[1] i stumbled over the \"related changes\" tab control, that has different tabs for\n\n* related changed\n* conflict changes\n* same topic changes\n* cherry-pick changes\n\nSo now actually all four different tabs are related changes and i think is right to call the whole tab control: related changes, but then we have a problem to call the first tab with the same name.\n\nSo may be the name\n\n\"Dependent changes\" is better for the tab that was called first related changes until additional tabs were introduced and the first tabs was not renamed to better fir the new situation? In fact the REST API endpoint still called \"related\" and would better be renamed to \"dependent\"\n\nSo we would have something like that:\n\n\nRelated changes tab control\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nshows four different tabs:\n\n* Dependent changes\n* conflict changes (only enabled when secondary index on the site is activated)\n* same topic changes\n* cherry-pick changes\n\nNote, that the different tabs can have the same changes listed in them.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/51975",

      "message": "Actually when adding the new tabs I was thinking about renaming the first tab to something like \"Dependencies\". I finally didn\u0027t do it because from a Dependencies tab you would expect to see open changes on which the current change depends and open changes that depend on the current change. This is what is displayed for normal changes in the Related Changes tab. However for merge commits it shows also the closed changes that are going to be merged into the destination branch by accepting the merge commit. It is kind of a dependency too, but not in the sense of \"these changes have to be submitted in order to submit this change\". I guess this is the reason why it was called Related Changes in the first place. I\u0027m not against renaming the tab and also \u0027Dependencies\u0027 might just be fine, but while looking for a better name we should keep in mind what it shows for merge commits.",
