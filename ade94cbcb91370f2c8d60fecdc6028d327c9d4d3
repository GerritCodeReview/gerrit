      "message": "What this change is trying to do is merging these two types:\n```\nGenerateUrlDashboardViewParameters\n  repo?: RepoName;\n```\n```\nDashboardViewState\n  project?: RepoName;\n```\n\nSo we have to decide for one. :-)\n\nHistorically Gerrit has at some point seen a huge rename effort: `Project` was renamed to `Repo` everywhere that was user facing. But there are some left-overs. We should really try to get rid of `project` as much as possible, but I did not want to pollute my refactorings with these kinds of separate clean-ups. Also note that in some places `project` will just stick, for example the file name `project.config` is unlikely to change ever, although it should be `repo.config` in an ideal world.\n\nFrom a logical perspective `repo` and `project` are just synonyms.",
