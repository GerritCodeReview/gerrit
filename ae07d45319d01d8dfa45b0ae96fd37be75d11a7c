      "message": "Hi, Martin\n thank you for your review. \nand will you please let me know the detail of the reason . \ndo you mean this is the Google code style that require to have one bland line between different import source package?\n\nI often find we cost some time on check code style so I think\nhere is a chance for me to share my idea .I have wanted to ask a question for a long time that \n is it feasible to let google code style format.xml having this restrict ? so that developer can get some hints if there is some code style error  before upload code  and reviewer can save time. \n  \nalso as Gerrit source code structure is maven project, why not introduce checkstyle plugin .and create related configure file and add it to pom.xml, this plugin is really good . reference to  http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/.\n \nthanks in advance",

      "message": "The eclipse setup page mentions tools/GoogleFormat.xml.  I admit that since I don\u0027t use eclipse, it doesn\u0027t do me much good.  I would be happy if you could integrate style checking in the build, although I would suggest that it only emit warnings, not errors.\n\nFor somethings, such as spacing between imports, I just get my cues from the patterns that I see in the files that I edit. It would be nice to have additional documentation about stylistic stuff that probably can\u0027t be well described in an xml file, things like function placement in files.  We started something like that at the hack-a-thon, I don\u0027t know what happened to it?",

I have configure tools/GoogleFormat.xml to my eclipse but it did not give me any warnings when I deleted these 2 blank lines, so I want change to other IDE  :)  \nit is really good news that the hack-a-thon is going on , I expect to it\u0027s result. before that I will keep in my mind some code style rules like not delete any existing blank lines :)\n\nthanks a lot again for your giving me  these directions and  information!!",
