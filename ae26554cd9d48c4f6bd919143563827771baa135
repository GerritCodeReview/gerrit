Can we agree on this and move forward with my REST API series and your mergeability series?\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/57909/7/gerrit-extension-api/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/extensions/api/changes/ChangeType.java\n* [2] \"I seem to recall this coming up before, but IMHO CodedEnum is an implementation detail of the storage layer, and shouldn\u0027t need to leak into the common extension API.\"\n* [3] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/57933",

So sorry about that.\n\nBut do not point the finger at me saying I destroyed your work. I gave specific suggestions for how to work around this problem, and instead of following them, you threw up your hands and abandoned the change. That\u0027s on you.",
