      "message": "Remember the use case is:\n\n  .add(RPC callback A)\n  ...(more RPC callbacks)...\n  .add(RPC callback B is a ScreenLoadCallback)\n\nIf you\u0027re suggesting we call B.onSuccess() even if A failed, that won\u0027t work. In order to display either the screen or an error message, we must guarantee that either B.onSuccess() or B.onFailure() is called. If A fails but B succeeds, we would call B.onSuccess(), which will display a partially-filled-in screen. Not good.\n\nWhat I meant here (and hopefully I communicated in the javadoc) is to give _every_ callback the _first_ failure. This means if A fails, we call B.onFailure(A\u0027s exception). The point is we need to call B.onFailure() with _some_ exception to get the error dialog. We could try a little harder to match up callbacks to exceptions in the case of multiple successes and multiple failures, but that seemed like more effort than it\u0027s worth.\n\nObviously what I have here does do every failure to every callback, which is not what I meant.
