      "message": "To expand on this a bit more if you try to ssh to the latest Gerrit as built by this Dockerfile [0] using an RSA key with an up to date openssh client you get \"debug1: send_pubkey_test: no mutual signature algorithm\" and authentication fails. \n\nThe reason is that even though Gerrit has updated to MINA 2.8.0 it didn\u0027t register a kex handler that can handle server-sig-algs to negotiate an RSA+SHA2 signature algorithm. This change explicitly register\u0027s MINA\u0027s new default kex handler which implements server-sig-algs. With that in place you can see the client finds server-sig-algs which include RSA+SHA2 options and it selects one of those. Authentication succeeds in this case.",
