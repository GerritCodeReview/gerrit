      "message": "I gave it a try and cherry-picked this change (and it\u0027s predecessor that bumps jgit) on top of the series:\n\n1. There are a few new error prone issues which seem to have been introduced in a stable branch since you made that change (AutoValueSubclassLeaked, FloggerStringConcatenation), but those are trivial to fix.\n  \n2. Usages of java.util.Date for which we suppressed the JdkObsolete warning (@SuppressWarnings(\"JdkObsolete\") are now flagged due to JavaUtilDate (not sure if JavaUtilDate would find new issues).",
