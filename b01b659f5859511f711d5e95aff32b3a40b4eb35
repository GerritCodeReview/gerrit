You could use the reindex flume by adding all the user refs as input to the staleness check.\n\nHowever\n\n* upstream Gerrit doesn\u0027t have flumes.\n\n* if we\u0027re trying to not persist PII, to me it seems most logical to avoid persisting it all places, including the index.\n\n\u003e In the same commit message, we might have templates for multiple accounts, which means frontend would have to call backend to get account information for each of the accounts in the message.\n\ncorrect. But we get the account IDs involved from NoteDb footers, right? So we can ship them in the ChangeInfo, without much extra overhead. \n\n\u003e each time we add a new feature we would have to add frontend support to it\n\nThe avatar/chip idea is probably nicer than necessary, but if you do textual substitution, it seems like an equal amount of work, whether you do it in the frontend or the backend, no?",

The \u0027Changes\u0027 table should not contain names of users - just references to their IDs as foreign keys. That in the end also applies to in-string mentions.\nIf you compare our storage to a relational database, it\u0027s not that NoteDb is the equivalent of the relational database, it\u0027s actually that NoteDb+Indices provide a functionality comparable to the relational database (that has indices built in).
