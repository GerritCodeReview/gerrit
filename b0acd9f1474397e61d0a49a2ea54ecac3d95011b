If you want people to actually set up their editors, I think we\u0027re going to need some more detailed/specific instructions.",

      "message": "Since devs are using different tools (there was a short discussion in change I669f0ec7f), it would lead in a quote long documentation how to set it up everywhere.\n\nAs I have written earlier in this change, I will add a Gulp (Node.js) script to run linters in a follow-up change. Andy has suggested to add a pre commit hook also which should be easy to implement. Also, it would be nice to have a CI running these checks.",

      "message": "I think it\u0027s almost the same issue as we currently have with tests: we have a lot of great tests, but they are not automatically verified and from time to time people break it.\n\nIf I\u0027m the only one who sees an advantage of having these config files already which are picked up by IDEs, I\u0027m okay with holding it up until we have some automated testing.\n\n \u003e Also for the record I would strongly prefer no gulpfiles in this project.\n\nCan you please elaborate a bit more on this? What alternatives do you see? I think Node.js / Gulp provides a great toolchain for doing such tasks with just a few LOC (running linters is just a small tasks - I also use browsersync.io for developing this project which makes it a lot more comfortable).",
