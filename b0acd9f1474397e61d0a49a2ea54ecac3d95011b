If you want people to actually set up their editors, I think we\u0027re going to need some more detailed/specific instructions.",

Andy has suggested to add a pre commit hook also which should be easy to implement. Also, it would be nice to have a CI running these checks.",

What alternatives do you see? I think Node.js / Gulp provides a great toolchain for doing such tasks with just a few LOC (running linters is just a small tasks - I also use browsersync.io for developing this project which makes it a lot more comfortable).",

      "message": "Tests and lint checks are fundamentally different with the former being required and the latter being a nice-to-have.\n\nI agree with Dave that bringing in yet another tool should be looked at with a very skeptical eye. If one intends to use Gulp for performing tasks on file changes (a very tempting thing to do), then this creates a problem. One of the main development points is that you can make a change and reload without skipping a beat (which is why we’re not doing transpiling on the fly or other things like this).\n\nI am skeptical of adding Yet Another Thing™ as a dependency for development that we expect devs to install or run.",

      "message": "As far as I understand, we already depend on Node.js which is wrapped by BUCK. So there would be no new dependencies. We could even eliminate the Go dependency for \u0027server.go\u0027 (which is IMHO not documented yet) with a few lines Node.js.\n\n@Andy: Not sure if have understand your point about file changes correctly. Just to make it clear: my script just watches for changes, runs linters on it and refreshes the browser (this is probably what you do after every change with F5 when you switch to your browser). It does *not* modify any files at any time. No developer would be forced to run the script - but everyone who likes to make development flow more comfortable is free to use it.\n\nEven when we run the linters only on a CI, we would need some logic to execute it (e.g. extract JS out of the HTML files).\n\nWhat are your alternatives / suggestions?\n\nIf you are not interested in such code hygiene tools at all, please tell me. In that case I will abandon this chance and put not any more efforts into this.",
