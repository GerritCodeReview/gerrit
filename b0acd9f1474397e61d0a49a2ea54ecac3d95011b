If you want people to actually set up their editors, I think we\u0027re going to need some more detailed/specific instructions.",

      "message": "Since devs are using different tools (there was a short discussion in change I669f0ec7f), it would lead in a quote long documentation how to set it up everywhere.\n\nAs I have written earlier in this change, I will add a Gulp (Node.js) script to run linters in a follow-up change. Andy has suggested to add a pre commit hook also which should be easy to implement. Also, it would be nice to have a CI running these checks.",
