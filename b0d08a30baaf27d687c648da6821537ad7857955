      "message": "One of our most common and costly support tickets is to help inexperienced users that wrongly used the old refs/changes/ namespace for uploading new patchsets.\n\nTypically the users google \"how to update changes in Gerrit\" and sometimes finds the documentation on how to push the old way, eg. pushing to \"refs/changes/\" instead of using the \"Change-Id:\"-footer with the \"refs/for/\"-namespace.\n\nBy pushing new patchsets to \"refs/changes/\" it is very easy to accidentally push to the wrong change (or perhaps they accidentally removed the change-id footer and got a new one). Regardless, they now have a \"Change-Id:\"-footer that does not match the internal change-id of the destination change. This is where things starts to get really confusing for the users.\n\nBy just ensuring that the \"Change-Id:\"-footer of the new patchset matches the internal Change-Id of the destination change, we can ensure that the user catches their error before everything spirals out of control.\n\nSo far, we have never seen a push to \"refs/changes/\", where the user intended to have a \"Change-Id:\"-footer that does not match the internal Change-Id of the destination change.",
