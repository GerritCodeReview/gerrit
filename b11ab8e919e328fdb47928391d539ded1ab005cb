It is needed for some plugins to check whether or not a committer is a bot (CI). In that case some checks should be skipped, lice contribution agreement checks or sign-off-by footer.\n\nThis is needed for Eclipse Foundation plugin: [1], as alternative approach for abandoned Submit rules check approach in change 275054.\n\n[1] https://github.com/EclipseFdn/gerrit-eca-plugin",
