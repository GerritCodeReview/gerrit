      "message": "This way of phrasing it makes me confused for the same reason I was confused by patch set 1 of the concept-changes page. Saying a change is a group of patch sets doesn\u0027t tell me why the patch sets were grouped that way, and my first instinct is to think that they are related by being in the same topic, not by being multiple revisions of a change.\n\nI wonder if describing it in terms of changes up front would be simpler. E.g. how about something like \"A patch set represents a single revision of a link:concept-change.html[change] under review\"?",

I think the content there explains both changes and patch sets quite well.\n\nThis results in a bit of duplication between two topics. I think that is very acceptable. We cannot know how a user might enter the documentation (they may come across the patch set topic first, or they may come across the Changes topic first). Having some duplication is a worthwhile trade-off if it helps user comprehension.",
