      "message": "`therefore` here is a bit weird... since the reason that this is a private method seems have nothing to do with what you mentioned before `therefore`.\n\nAnd i think that PageLoad event before was already sending all navigation timing before, you basically don\u0027t check for non-zero `loadEventEnd` for this change. I am not sure what\u0027s the implication of having the navigation and resource timings reported immediately without waiting for the `loadEventEnd` as `If this event has not yet been sent, or is not yet completed, returns 0`, if that happens, will we collect the right navigation and resource timing at all ?\n\nmaybe consider adopting the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming/loadEventEnd which is replacing the performance timing (I did not really look into this that much tho)",
