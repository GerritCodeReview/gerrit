      "message": "Why I don\u0027t like to use Optional#get here:\n\n- Static code analyzers (e.g. IntelliJ inspections) which check for Optional#isPresent before Optional#get would complain. I find those checks very useful and wouldn\u0027t want to switch them off. To me, they have the same significance as checks which ensure that objects marked as nullable aren\u0027t accessed without null checks. Arguably, I could add a SuppressWarnings but that would never cover all code analyzers and is ugly compared to the alternatives.\n- Others (or myself in some years) might wonder why Optional#isPresent was forgotten. To increase readability (and avoid repeated cognitive effort), I would need to explain in the code why Optional#isPresent isn\u0027t necessary here. A comment would be an option. However, typically it\u0027s recommended to write the code in a way such that comments aren\u0027t necessary. So, a comment wouldn\u0027t be any better.\n- Whenever I need to access the value of an Optional, I spend some thoughts on which way is best. Only if I really need to use Optional#get (e.g. because there\u0027s a checked exception involved somewhere and hence Optional#map can\u0027t be used), I do so but always make sure to include Optional#isPresent. That\u0027s kind of an automatism. If I start to freely use Optional#get (without any pain attached), I worry that I develop bad habits. That might sound like a small issue but remember how sun.misc.Unsafe was never supposed to be used as widespread as it is nowadays. Its use got socially acceptable and hardly anybody spares a thought when using it (pre-Java-9).\n- Taking up the previous point, I always try to make the code as robust and resilient as possible. When code changes over time, I can\u0027t be sure that my original assumptions still hold. It\u0027s so easy to open up a new code path which executes the code in a slightly different way. Of course, tests should catch those cases but why not have an additional safety net. Why not design a class/method in such a way that it is hard to use it wrong or to break it? One could argue that we would like to generate exceptions and thus get informed about the system not behaving as we would like to. However, I think that we don\u0027t want to run into such situations with production code. In my opinion, production systems should behave as gracefully as possible provided they can still work correctly. Whether a class works as expected should be ensured by tests. So, if possible, I try to use Optional#ifPresent or Optional#orElseGet. In this case, I originally didn\u0027t go that way because I didn\u0027t know how to deal with an unknown serverId (which is necessary for the AuditLogFormatter). In the meantime, I changed my opinion and created I5466e586ee. I can squash it into this change if you prefer that.",
