This means you can now trigger queries which a larger limit than the max limit that is supported by the index backend (not really because if the index backend has a max limit, setting --no-limit triggers an exception in QueryProcessor.query which add +1 to the limit, making this limit fall over to MIN_INTEGER and then resulting in a failure).",
