      "message": "I could put it into _compute... but I thought that was meant to only be called by Polymer through computed properties. I need this logic also in _loadDiffAssets (line 393) to check a diff that has not yet been set to this._diff (because that would trigger re-rendering, which we only want to do after having loaded the assets).\n\nI am submitting this as is for now - you can still respond on the comment if you\u0027d prefer me to call _compute... instead and I will clean it up. I just thought such a method might be useful separately anyways in other parts of the app.",
