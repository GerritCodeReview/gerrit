Could you also work that into a static SshSession.configFactory() or similar?\n\n* TestSshKeys has \"if (isMina())\" could that also be split?\n\nin other news, someone on Terry\u0027s team was assigned to work on the mina SSH bug. It may still take a while before it gets completed, though.\n\n\n",

      "message": "All comments should be addressed. All MINA SSH client code is now isolated in two classes:\n\n* acceptance tests code: SshSessionFactory\n* production code: SshSessionFactoryInitializer\n\n\u003e in other news, someone on Terry\u0027s team was assigned to work on the mina SSH bug. \n\nGreat news, thanks @Terry!\n\nNevertheless we should merge this series ASAP, and deliver MINA SSHD client integration in upcoming gerrit release.\n\nWhat still wasn\u0027t answered: can we merge the whole series as is, or should we squash this series in one single (huge) change?\n\nI also think that the tip of this series: change 269976, the removal of JCraft JSch library should be postponed until Terry\u0027s is done with the migration to Apache MINA SSH (otherwise Gerrit@Google wouldn\u0027t be able to run SSH tests).\n\nIOW, in upcoming gerrit release we would still have both options for SSH client libraries:\n\n* Apache MINA SSH (enabled per default)\n* JCraft JSch\n\nThat raises the question, whether we should setup SSH client specific checkers:\n\n* Test/Build against JCraft JSch\n* Test/Build against Apache MINA SSH\n\nthat would double the time for CI verification, unfortunately. Alternatively we could only enable those two kinds onf tests on CI for stable branches and master, and not on each and every change.",
