I guess that \"with rebase in between\" is more precise than \"with others in between\" for someone familiar with Git.\n\nTrying to understand what exactly this method is: it seems like it is checking that the result of:\n\n  git merge-base A B\n\nis neither of:\n\n  A, B, A^, B^\n\nAssuming this is true I would at least put this into the javadoc of this method.",
