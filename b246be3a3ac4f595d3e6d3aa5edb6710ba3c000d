Asciidoc interprets the text enclosed by the two \u0027*\u0027 to be formatted in bold printing. I guess to fix the formatting the first \u0027*\u0027 in the line needs to be escaped, same as it was done in change 31770 [1].\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/31770/2/Documentation/access-control.txt",
