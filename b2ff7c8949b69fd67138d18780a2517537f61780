      "message": "The problem occurs when a user is a member of a group that in turn is a member fo a group. Gerrit misses the fact that the user is a member of the grandparent group. The reason for this is that the groups that the user is a direct member of has been added to groupsDN earlier which makes the if-statement on line 369 fail, which in turn stops the recursive lookup.\r\nIts worth mentioning that while this takes care of the bug, it (obviously) makes the login take longer time. I am thinking of supplying a patch that caches the ldap-data a bit more aggressively than what is currently done to fix that.",
