      "message": "Perhaps the focus of some of the implementation of this change should focus on the idea of \"creating new patchsets\" and editing the commit message is really just a piece of that bigger idea.  So, for example this method might be better off as createNewPatchset() and just happen to only take a commitMessage as a parameter.\n\nIt might be worth presenting this to the user that way a bit also, so instead of a popup with words about the commit message and a warning about the fact that it creates a new patchset, the popup could be titled \"Creating a New PatchSet\" and then you could dispense with the warning.  Eventually this popup might even get enhanced to be the final step of inline editing.",
