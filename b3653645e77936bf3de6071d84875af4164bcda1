      "message": "Thanks for adding it. Actually it looks like that the get-test-tools support for GWT 2.7 was fixed in this pull request: [1] and this PR was even merged. Unfortunately the author seems to be disappeared, and nobody can make a new release. I wonder if someone from maintainers can take over it, build new release from master and upload to Google storage bucket? At very least, with `local_jar()` (or pointing to MAVEN_LOCAL), gwt-test-utils could be adjusted and new unit test can be verified.\n\n  local_jar(\n  name \u003d \u0027gwt-test-utils\u0027,\n  [...]\n\n* [1] https://github.com/gwt-test-utils/gwt-test-utils/pull/69",
