This is important\nbecause a not large enough cache will start evicting entries from\nitself as its current size approaches its max size.\nSince the cache (how it is implemented in this patch-set) doesn\u0027t\nhave a loader, there is no way to reload an evicted entry except\nto tell the affected user to again remove/add his keys.\nDoing the remove/add once may be acceptable, but having to repeat it\nis not acceptable.",
