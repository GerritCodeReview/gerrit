The changes that fail produce tracebacks like this: https://paste.opendev.org/show/bjkm3wtVzLiPJxO9Qq0q/\n\nThis change appears to be fixing a bug introduced in master during the 3.8 release development (I7c8af57e8) but the fix was only applied to master during the 3.9 release development and not backported to stable-3.8. We backport this change as we believe it will address the errors identified before and was simply missed when originally fixed against 3.9.",
