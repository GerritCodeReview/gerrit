Two contributors Bob and Alice are uploading a change to project Foo. Bob must sign CLA and include \"Signed-off-by\" otherwise the push will be rejected. Alice must not sign CLA and include \"Signed-off-by\" footer, because she is committer of the project Foo. To determine that Alice is committer and Bob is not a committer of the project Foo, SUBMIT permission is checked. \n\n \u003e The refactoring happened over 3 years ago, and no one complained until now, so I am trying to understand the use case fully.\n\nIt took years to migrate Eclipse Foundation\u0027s Gerrit site from 2.14 release to 3.x: [3].\n\n\u003e If we have to we could name it SUBMIT_TO, so that you can check if a user can \"submit to\" a ref.\n\nI have no problem to rename RefPermission.SUBMIT to RefPermission.SUBMIT_TO.\n\n[1] https://github.com/EclipseFdn/gerrit-eca-plugin\n[2] https://github.com/EclipseFdn/gerrit-eca-plugin/pull/16\n[3] https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d541221",

Is there another link between \"committer\" and a permission you could check instead? E.g. are committers project owners?

Usually it\u0027s group membership, not a permission that distinguishes such users.\n\nHave you considered adding \"committers\" to the autoVerify group of the CLA? This makes the CLA check pass without them having to sign it.\n\n[1] https://github.com/EclipseFdn/gerrit-eca-plugin",
