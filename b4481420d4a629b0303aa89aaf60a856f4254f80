Why is it not OK to create a change that the uploader can\u0027t submit (but someone else might)?\n\nThe refactoring happened over 3 years ago, and no one complained until now, so I am trying to understand the use case fully.\n\nChecking \"Submit\" on a ref feels unidiomatic because you can\u0027t submit a ref, you can only submit a change. If we have to we could name it SUBMIT_TO, so that you can check if a user can \"submit to\" a ref.",
