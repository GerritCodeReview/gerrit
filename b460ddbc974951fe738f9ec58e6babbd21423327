I know that was historically not used when auth\u003dHTTP, but you could amend the behaviour because this change is for master where we do allow breaking changes as long as they are properly documented and notified on the release notes.\n\nHaving yet another config option looks like a tech debt we\u0027ll need to remove anyway at some point in the future.",
