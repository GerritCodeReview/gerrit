      "message": "Thanks, Delphine! I like those ideas very much, but unfortunately they would take a substantial amount of time to implement (and maintain). Comparing the cost with the benefit I would prefer to keep the change as is and spend the time on other outstanding issues. I think clicking on tag chips is a nice long tail feature that can sometimes help some users, but it is not a primary user journey, and as such can maybe have less polish. WDYT?",

      "message": "One improvement I can see is to also allow users to filter by tag in the current \"Filter by regular expression\" box.\nSo have a filter box \"Filter by tag or regular expression\" to make this feature also discoverable from the input field. Also since the tag will be in this input field, it would also be consistent for users to write an input (a string) and see the results linked to this tag. WDYT?",
