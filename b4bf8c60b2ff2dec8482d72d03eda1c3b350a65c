But please do feel free to add the hashtag suggestion to that tracker\u0027s thread, at will.\n\n\u003e In the Gardener project we use a section for the release note entry in each pull request (not in the commit message, e.g. [1]) which also defines the audience of those release note entries (developer, operator, user).

Reminds me of PR templates [4], too. You may also add this suggestion to Issue 11123, yourself using your own words, at will. Thanks @Matthias for this and your review of this change since a few days; it helped.\n\n[4] https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository\n\nUntil a more advanced solution is found through Issue 11123\u0027s resolution, I think we still need this release_noter script and its upcoming improvements. This is so that we can generate initial (and often lengthy) release notes skeletons to start from. Otherwise we end up missing items, especially when a release was long due.",
