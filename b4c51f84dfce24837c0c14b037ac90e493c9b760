Other than that, the prolog interpreter does not rely on having Change-Id in the commit message. \nOr, are you asking whether or not that should be delegated to prolog?",

      "message": "This change seems like it is meant to allow each project owner to define what is a valid commit for their project?  Since the setting I mention checks certain requirements (Change-Id), and your new change seems to implement that as a default requirement, I was wondering if the intent of this change was to replace the old mechanism to check for this requirement since project owners could now use your mechanism to do so.  If so, then I was wondering what would happen to the old mechanism.",
