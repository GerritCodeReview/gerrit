      "message": "It was pointed out by Christian: [1] that after removing this dependency commons:io is not provided any more in gerrit (as solr was the only one who used this dep as its transitive dependency), but still provided in plugin-api. That\u0027s obviously wrong. This not only broke quite some plugins, most notably rabbitmq and replication, but also broke the plugins in obscure way: they compile (plugin-api and gerrit-core still include this dependency), but they cannot be loaded as this dependency is missing in final gerrit artifact.\n\nThe proper solution would be: to drop commons:io from gerrit core, and add the proper dependency to plugins and provide this library in their shaded jar.\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/69916",
