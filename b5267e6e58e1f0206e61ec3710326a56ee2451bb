The old version used string append to show each line on its own line in the source file, avoiding any one line being longer than 80 characters, and making it easy to identify the line breaks in the text.\n\nSince LibraryDownloader is invoked only once or twice during the first site init, its not performance critical. The readable source was preferred over avoiding append.",
