      "message": "Before change I76c161275 GerritServer.start didn\u0027t call daemon.setEnableHttpd, then httpd in Deamon was null, and Deamon set it to true if it was not a replica [1]. This means HTTPD was enabled for these tests before change I76c161275, which is fine since @NoHttpd only says HTTPD is not required, but it\u0027s OK if it\u0027s enabled anyway. @NoHttp doesn\u0027t mean that SSHD is required, if SSHD is required tests are annotated with @UseSsh which are the tests that we skip.\n\n[1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/master/java/com/google/gerrit/pgm/Daemon.java#285",
