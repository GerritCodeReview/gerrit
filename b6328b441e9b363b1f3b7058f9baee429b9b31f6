      "message": "This is interesting. I had to actually look at the implementation of StandardBaseEncoding to see that close() is not a no-op (or just a wrapper for flush()). It writes out any pending padding. As far as being a leak, it\u0027s a false positive, as neither the stream nor the writer actually holds on to any resources besides a buffer that gets GCed.\n\nI\u0027m not opposed to fixing this, since some libraries are picky about padding.\n\nThat said, the fix should actually be:\n\n try (OutputStreamWriter w \u003d new OutputStreamWriter(out, ISO_8859_1);\n     OutputStream e \u003d BaseEncoding.base64().encodingStream(w)) {\n   src.writeTo(e);\n   e.flush();\n }",
