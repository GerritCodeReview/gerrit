      "message": "The test failures were caused by the fact that the test framework instantiated a new object for this every time while the gerrit server is reused when there are no @GerritConfig annotations. So a different instance was bound than available in the test.\n\nUsing a static variable isn\u0027t great, but it is in line with what the other tests that use createModule do.\n\nWe should rework this at some point together with the other tests that use a static variable to work around the injector issue.",
