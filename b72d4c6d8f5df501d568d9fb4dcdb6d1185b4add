      "message": "FYI this is a purely in-memory cache, and the default binding will give you a hard-coded size of 10M blame regions. I suspect for a large, active server that is probably too small; we get pretty low blame cache hit rates\n\nI would encourage you to consider implementing a persistent blame cache. One of the reasons I had not previously exposed Gitiles\u0027 BlameCache as a library is I kind of wanted to do that within Gitiles using the Gerrit H2-based cache implementation. But you could do it entirely within Gerrit, using a separate implementation using the Gerrit persistent cache framework that delegates to BlameCacheImpl for its Loader/Weigher. That is what we do for googlesource.com and that\u0027s why all those classes are public.",
