      "message": "It would be nice to have a curl command that can directly be copied and pasted. However I\u0027m not sure if I like to duplicate all the curl commands that we are having currently in our documentation (in 4 files). Would it make sense to simply substitute \u0027review.example.com\u0027 in all the curl commands with \u0027gerrit-review.googlesource.com\u0027? Anyway that it is not really related to my change and should be done in an own change?",
