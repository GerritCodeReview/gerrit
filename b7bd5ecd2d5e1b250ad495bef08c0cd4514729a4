      "message": "I believe that viewState would be reset with a full-app refresh, though it would solve the issue of just navigating to/from diffs/change views.  \n\nI think it really depends on if we want state to remain with a full app refresh/coming back on a new day, or just in the current session.  It might be helpful if the state was preserved longer than viewState would allow, but I think this could be an interesting discussion.",
