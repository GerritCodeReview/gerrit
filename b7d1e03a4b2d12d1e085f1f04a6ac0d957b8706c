      "message": "- Should delete by rewrite become the default for ExternalIds and SshKeys? I think making this the default is the right approach since a user shouldn\u0027t be forced to delete their account to actually delete some of their PII.\n\n- As described in the commit message, I didn\u0027t touch the `ExternalIdNotes#replace()` workflow. I would like to address this, potentially in a later change, if you are okay with making delete with rewrite the default behavior.\n\n- I provided a default implementation for VersionedMetaData#onRewrite. Should children be forced to implement?\n",
