      "message": "With NoteDb, there is absolutely no way to adjust the \u0027createdOn\u0027 timestamp after creating a group. In addition, you can\u0027t specify it to be \u0027null\u0027 when creating a group. I deliberately chose the implementation in a way that such loopholes (forbidden states) aren\u0027t possible. As the schema upgrade which sets all \u0027createdOn\u0027 timestamps of existing groups should have run in a prior release, I figured that we could just delete this test.",
