      "message": "This is necessary now, because compiler.py was producing ui_agent.zip directly and gwt_binary produces ui_agent.war under subdirectory:\n\n  ./buck-out/gen/gerrit-gwtui/__gwt_binary_ui_safari__/ui_safari.war\n\nAfter this rule we have:\n\n ./buck-out/gen/gerrit-gwtui/ui_safari.zip\n\nAnd gerrit_war() and war () rules assumed to find it there and failed. I think it\u0027s a bug (or at least unexpected) that suffix of GWT binary is war. It should be \".zip\".\n\nNote:\n\n  buck build gerrit\n\nwas working because we have own wrapper target for combined ui_optdbg.zip artifact and it worked. Only single use agent permutation was broken.",
