      "message": "You\u0027re right that we can do better in some cases. For instance, a comment range starting before modified lines and ending after the modified block could be mapped to a new position. Our porting logic just doesn\u0027t support it at the moment. I tried to quickly improve the logic but found out that it requires more considerations (and many more tests) than I originally thought. That\u0027s also the reason why I adjusted the portedRangeCommentStartingBeforeButEndingAfterModifiedLineCanBePorted to portedRangeCommentStartingBeforeButEndingAfterModifiedLineBecomesFileComment() in this change and decided to postpone any improvements to the porting logic. After we have all cases for ported comments covered (e.g. also porting comments on base; filtering out resolved comment threads), we can think about such improvements. Maybe, you\u0027d be interested in implementing such improvements yourself. :-) What do you think?",
