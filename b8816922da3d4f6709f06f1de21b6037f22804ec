      "message": "Well, on second thought this is actually not true. We are not removing the dependency on ES, we are forking parts of the ES. Moreover, if you check the code of the forked classes on master, here one example: ExistsQueryBuilder.java [1], it would be clear, that this code depends on Lucene and on the rest of the ES server code.\n\nIn the same time, the query constructions depend on the ES version, e.g.: [2]. So that the generated queries on the client side depend on the used server version (logically).\n\nIOW, we just can\u0027t guarantee, that the same Gerrit version, that is known to work with say ES 2.x, would work unchanged (!) against ES 5.x, ..., N. We would have to adjust the ES client code, meant to adjust Gerrit core to work against another ES version.\n\n* [1] https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/ExistsQueryBuilder.java#L22-L39\n* [2] https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/ExistsQueryBuilder.java#L151-L153",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I understand this statement. Do you mean, that you could preserve the same client/queries construction code in say Gerrit 2.14.10 but bump ES from 2.4 to 5.x or even 6.x? This wouldn\u0027t work. Or do you mean to bump the Gerrit ES client/queries code in say 2.14.11 to work against ES 5.x or even 6.x, without changing Lucene release?\n\nAfter investigating the forked code, I have concerns, that we are on the wrong way here trying artificially de-couple stuff that is simply tightly coupled. See: [1]. And we would have to spend substantial efforts to upgrade our ES forked code (if this would work at all or we even end up forking the whole ES server code and not only dozen classes).\n\nWhat if we give up on fork and de-coupling attempts and just accept, that ES and Lucene are depend on each other for now? We could still replace Jest with low level rest client (or even high level rest client), and just update the ES and Lucene in the same time? Just one example, in Gerrit 2.16 we upgrade ES to 5 and Lucene to 6, and in the Gerrit version after 2.16, we would update ES to 6.x and Lucene to 7.x. Wouldn\u0027t this be enough?\n\nAnother approach that we havn\u0027t explored yet, is to remove both Lucene and ES index vendors as core modules and only left generic index interface java/com/google/gerrit/index package, and make different index vendors and version pluggable: both client/query code. That way, we could compose final gerrit verion as a combination of gerrit + index vendor with specific version:\n\n* Gerrit 3.0 + Lucene module vesion 6.x\n* Gerrit 3.0 + Lucene module vesion 7.x\n* Gerrit 3.0 + ES mode version 5.x\n* Gerrit 3.0 + ES mode version 6.x\n\nThis is more or less what Google is doing internally, adding their proprietary index client implementation to their Gerrit fork.\n\n* [1] https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29184",
