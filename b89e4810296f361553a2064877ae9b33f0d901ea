      "message": "I was in-fact testing a patch I had which was similar to the one in PS2 now. My local test site had 35k changes across 4 projects, of which 33k belonged to a single project. My machine had 6 cores, so I used 6 threads. Using threads more than number of cores was degrading the performance in my setup. Here are some stats from my tests:\n\nwithout change:\nReindexed 35540 documents in changes index in 709.0s (50.1/s)\n\nwith change(with 6 threads):\nReindexed 35540 documents in changes index in 318.2s (111.7/s)",
