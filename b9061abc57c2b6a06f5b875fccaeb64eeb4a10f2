I could still see refs/heads/master, even though I wasn\u0027t that one user blessed to see it.  What\u0027s happening is the ProjectControl isn\u0027t able to find a match for refs/* locally, so it goes to the inherited refs.  It never realizes we are asking about a wildcard and that the wildcard shouldn\u0027t be honored if there\u0027s a more specific branch level rule available.",
