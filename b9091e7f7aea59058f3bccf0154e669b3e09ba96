Not sure if it\u0027s much better since the required access rights depend on how the project configuration is changed.\n\n\u003e I\u0027d add a hint that if administrators want to be able to help project owners\n\u003e configuring their project\u0027s they should set similar permissions for \n\u003e administrators in All-Projects.\n\nAdministrators are owners of all projects, hence by default they can edit the config and access rights of all projects through the webUI. So nothing needs to be configured for this? I clarified at the places where it says that the user must be a project owner that being an admin also fulfils this.\n\n\u003e I would mention that the option receive.allowProjectOwnersToChangeParent can be\n\u003e used to enforce that project owners cannot escape permission restrictions defined \n\u003e in an ancestor of their project by reparenting their project without approval\n\u003e from an Administrator.\n\nGood idea, I\u0027ve included this into the follow-up change which adds information about inheritance (https://gerrit-review.git.corp.google.com/c/gerrit/+/394740)",

      "message": "I know that admins can change all project configs, but if a project owner or user has an issue and the admin has to first tweak project permissions needed to help, this takes time. Hence it may make sense to grant more permissions to admins from the start so that they are already in place when admin needs to help a project owner or end user. E.g. they could configure on All-Projects that admins have read access to all repos and whatever other permissions they deem necessary to help support their project owners and end users.",
