      "message": "Well...having gitweb.url set can mean either completely external, or, if gitweb.cgi is also set, internally managed at a non-default URL (which must be rewritten by an external proxy). Since in both cases, the handling of the gitweb URLs isn\u0027t under Gerrit\u0027s control, I figured it\u0027d be best to leave it as defaulting to non-path-info for both cases.\n\nOr did you just want different wording in the docs, rather than a change in behavior? (and if so, a suggestion as to what?)",
