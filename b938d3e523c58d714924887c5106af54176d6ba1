I haven\u0027t tested it though.\n\nAlso not, what that change is currently doing, is pointing the JGit jars built by bazel to the in-tree location, so for example for main libjgit.jar to:\n\n  /gerrit/lib/jgit/org.eclipse.jgit/src\n\nA different approach, that is out of scope for that change, is to (optionally?) generate two Eclipse root projects:\n\n* gerrit\n* jgit\n\nand add a Eclipse project dependency from gerrit project to eclipse project.",
