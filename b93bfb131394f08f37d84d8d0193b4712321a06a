      "message": "Thanks for adding this. There might just be one small possible interpretation which I hope readers don\u0027t have: The entire DiffContent shouldn\u0027t be considered as being an intraline edit. In Gerrit, we typically have the distinction between a line is edited (similar to Git which is only working on whole lines) and a section inside of the line is edited (which we have on top and are the intraline edits). If no intraline edits are available, the whole line can still be considered as being edited (and hence marked only with the color for whole line edits). Do you think you could make this a bit clearer?",
