      "message": "There are ways, but none are easy. :(  I will point you to some resources to help you better understand the problems involved.\n\nHere is the long thread started by Mohan over a year ago about solving a similar problem, it should help outline some of the problems anticipated back then:  https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups\u003d#!searchin/repo-discuss/mohan/repo-discuss/dZg-Tie8__A/deK7EIxTaDQJ\n\nHere are Mohan\u0027s abandoned attempts at in memory Gerrit locking: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+project:gerrit+branch:master+topic:cross-repo-dependencies,n,z I think there were still unsolved issues with this proposal.  Of course, such a solution would not likely be useful in a clustered Gerrit environment such as what gerrit-review runs as currently.\n\n\nHere is Shawn\u0027s idea last fall to support multi-repo transactions in jgit that unfortunately has either still had stale locking issues, or races:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups\u003d#!searchin/repo-discuss/mohan/repo-discuss/mI1l5-fesI8/z-Ez0lYBoUgJ\n\nHowever, if you still want to solve this, I proposed solutions to the git mailing list about creating \"recoverable\" locks/transactions that seemed to only have issues on some (likely non posix) filesystems.  The discussion started around here: http://marc.info/?l\u003dgit\u0026m\u003d135664993801178\u0026w\u003d2 but by first proposal was flawed, I think the valuable proposal which might work (no known flaws with posix FS) starts around here: http://marc.info/?l\u003dgit\u0026m\u003d135698411219549\u0026w\u003d2\n\nThese could be used to build up a solutions similar to Shawn\u0027s proposal for a clustered shared backend.  But that is not what you guys have at google anyway (and you can likely do locking more easily with your system).  So, I think you would need to abstract the locking piece in jgit anyway and then it is just a matter of implementing different backend systems and perhaps having a way to disable the feature if the backend does not support a safe locking mechanism?\n\nSo, currently there are only 2 real backends in the wild that you need to care about your clustered google system (ask Shawns how to solve this, the system already \"locks\" refs anyway using the DB for multi-master), and a single master system.   Since shared backend with multi master is not in that list, you can ignore both Shawn\u0027s (except for how he would integrate with jgit) and my locking proposals.   If you have a pluggable locking mechanism, the single master one could start by using in memory locking with the risk of colliding with direct git updates behind Gerrit\u0027s back (which is likely OK until someone cares to solve the problem better). You could even force it to overwrite any updates behind Gerrit\u0027s back if you wanted so that Gerrit will still be consistent.",

But also what if one change merges, but the other dependeny change fails its merge?  The fact that the superproject didn\u0027t update doesn\u0027t really help, you still have a broken state which may now require a rewind to fix.  Lastly, in the case when one change is merged but not the dependency, it could endup freezing the superproject in weird ways preventing further updates to it until the dependency is fixed.\n\nOverall, this sounds pretty hard to get right and have a decent user experience.  It would seem that simply updating superprojects manually would be easier for the user to understand.",

Another hack might be to use a special ancestor # (0, -1)... but I don\u0027t like either much.  The ancestor code is complex enough, I suspect you realize that since you added tons of nice new comments to some of it, :) we just spend ~1-3 weeks x 4 people creating nasty corner case dependency test cases (probably about 60 of them) and status reporting for gerrit (which I do hope to upstream at some point), so I know how bad it is.  But this just raises things to a new level of complexity.   \n\nI personally would support making first class DB objects to represent these properly, I don\u0027t know if others will?  But I suspect you will still need to solve harder problems if you want to actually support circular dependencies (locking).",
