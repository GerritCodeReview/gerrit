It sounds like this recursive process works its way up from a Submodules update to a superproject?  If so, then \"submodules of submodules\" seems misleading, superprojects of superprojects seems to better describe the flow (if I understand what this is supposed to do, I admit, I am guessing, I could use a bit more guidance from this commit message).",

Please, if it is not the case, let me know so I can try go get you a tutorial of how have it running, since https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gerrit_Submodules_Support is offline. Ulrik wrote it last year.\n\nMaybe it would be good to also have other reviewer comments here, Shawn pointed many issues in the past.\n\nI do not think it is required to have config option to disable the feature. It acts on commits having .gitmodule file, or on commits of registered submodules. The feature can work alone.",

      "message": "I agree, other reviewers would be great!  That is at least one good reason to ensure that your commit message does not assume too much off-line discussion and understanding from others.  \n\nAlso, while a bigger picture review of your intended changes is helpful (although, perhaps it should be in the gerrit issue tracker?), it is good to strive to make changes self explanatory via the commit message as much as possible.  A link in a commit message to support why a change does something is fine, but what the change does definitely could to be a bit clearer from the commit message.  I admit, as a reviewer, I know very little about so much Gerrit stuff, and some reviewers will know a lot less than I do.  So, unlike in the old days where you could assume Shawn knew at least the code you were touching (and soooo much about git), now you may sometimes have to educate your reviewers more (in small doses). :)\n\nHow would I be able to see the feature running if I do not quite know what to look for?  Yes, a tutorial, or docs would be great.  I review most changes at home on a 7\" android tablet, so the more I can understand without taking the time to compile and try out a feature, the more likely (and faster) I am to review a change.  I suspect that most non approvers would be even less likely to compile and try out a feature than me, and we really want to encourage more reviewers. \n\nSo don\u0027t take this personally, I really am just trying to raise the bar (to lower the bar for reviewers) in a way that will hopefully help grow the community.\n\nThanks!",

      "message": "If I understand this class\u0027 purpose, it describes the relation between super project branches and submodule branches?  Is the subscriber always the super project branch, and the subscription always the submodules branch?  If so, maybe better names for these 2 fields would just be superproject and submodule, or super and submodule, or superBranch and submoduleBranch, or supermodule and submodule.  While those names may not be so related to the subscription analogy, if they are accurate, I think that those names might make it more obvious what is being tracked here.",
