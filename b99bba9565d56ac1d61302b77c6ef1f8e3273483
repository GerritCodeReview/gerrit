It sounds like this recursive process works its way up from a Submodules update to a superproject?  If so, then \"submodules of submodules\" seems misleading, superprojects of superprojects seems to better describe the flow (if I understand what this is supposed to do, I admit, I am guessing, I could use a bit more guidance from this commit message).",

Please, if it is not the case, let me know so I can try go get you a tutorial of how have it running, since https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gerrit_Submodules_Support is offline. Ulrik wrote it last year.\n\nMaybe it would be good to also have other reviewer comments here, Shawn pointed many issues in the past.\n\nI do not think it is required to have config option to disable the feature. It acts on commits having .gitmodule file, or on commits of registered submodules. The feature can work alone.",

If so, maybe better names for these 2 fields would just be superproject and submodule, or super and submodule, or superBranch and submoduleBranch, or supermodule and submodule.  While those names may not be so related to the subscription analogy, if they are accurate, I think that those names might make it more obvious what is being tracked here.",
