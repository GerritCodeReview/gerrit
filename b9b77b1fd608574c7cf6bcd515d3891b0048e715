      "message": "Is there any guarantee on the ordering between _paramsChanged being called and selectedChangeIndex being propagated down into gr-change-list via l. 63?\n\nI\u0027m worried about a \"race\" where selectedChangeIndex is saved in a temp, then _paramsChanged is called, setting viewState.selectedChangeIndex, which propagates down to gr-change-list, then selectedChangeIndex is copied down again but using the old value from the temp.\n\nAdmittedly that seems a little farfetched, but I want to understand what guarantees we have.",

      "message": "I’m not sure I completely understand. Upon initial construction, gr-change-list will have it’s properties initialized and bound with observers firing, defaults set, etc. always before gr-change-list-view’s properties are initialized. So gr-change-list.selectedIndex is always set before gr-change-list-view._paramsChanged is called.\n\nWhere is the temp var that you’re referring to or are you talking about an underlying implementation detail?",
