      "message": "This looks much better. Now it really seems these two new methods would fit better in PatchList. Then on line 122 you could call toPatchList with both patchset ids (and perhaps the change or controlFactory). That would allow other users of PatchList in the future to use these new functions that aren\u0027t specific to the UI.",
