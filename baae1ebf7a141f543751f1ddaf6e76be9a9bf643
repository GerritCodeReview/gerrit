Cannot find the class file for com.google.protobuf.InvalidProtocolBufferException. Fix the build path then try building this project\nThe type com.google.protobuf.InvalidProtocolBufferException cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files\n\nWhen I revert this commit the problem goes away.\n",
