      "message": "I think the name \u0027rest\u0027 isn\u0027t accurate. This code is called both by the java and the rest api. We are a bit inconsistent with this naming in general IMHO:\n\n1) In acceptance tests, we have a package called \u0027rest\u0027 referring to HTTP tests\n2) In the extension API has a subpackage called \u0027restapi\u0027\n3) In httpd we have a subpackage called \u0027restapi\u0027\n\nCan we move these parts into server/api/config instead of creating a new subpackage in config?",
