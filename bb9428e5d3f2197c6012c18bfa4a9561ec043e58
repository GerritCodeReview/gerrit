      "message": "What would be best way how to highlight the code that should be reviewed?\n\n1, related-change-list-utils.ts where I would copy functionality from related-change-list and reference/call it from both old list and experimental?\n\n1b, should old gr-related-change-list start using new lit elements like gr-related-change? So I would extract code to lit element and reuse it on both?\n\n2, Just add comment to functions that there are from old gr-related-change-list?\n\nMy goal is to almost replicate structure and visual of gr-related-change-list. And then I want to modify it with different expanding functionality. This rewriting helps me to better understand all concepts of gr-related-change-list.",
