      "message": "There are (at least) three reasons to define a class method as static in java that doesn\u0027t access any instance variables:\n\n* 1. Documentation purpose. By defining the method as static, you clealry define the contract, that this method doens\u0027t change the state of the object instance and only operates on the method arguments\n* 2. You don\u0027t need a instance of the class to call this method (doesn\u0027t apply in this particular case, as the methods are protected anyway)\n* 3. There can be performance benefits of calling static methods comparing to non static methods, but this may be implementation specific (and modern hotspot JVMs may choose to optimize in ways that make static calls faster for one method, non-static calls faster for another). For example, static call can be made slightly more efficient because it doesn\u0027t need to do a virtual function lookup, and besides that it can also avoid the overhead of the hidden \"this\" parameter.",
