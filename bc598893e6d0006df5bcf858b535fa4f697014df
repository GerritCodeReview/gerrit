You cannot just pull one out.\n\nYou have to move `generateUrl()` and all the other `generate...()` methods into their own file (not url-util.ts).\n\nI have tried it quickly and it seems to be not a big deal.\n\nIt also makes sure that you don\u0027t forget `getBaseUrl()`, which I think is a bug in your current version of the change.",
