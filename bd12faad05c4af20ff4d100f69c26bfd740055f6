May be you just want to revert the whole change: [1]? Or at least provide exact steps and reverse proxy configuration to reproduce your issue and workaround with alternative reverse proxy configuration that fixed your issue? And the reason why the solution suggested by Doug, that fixed it cannot be applied on review.o.o.\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/57800",
