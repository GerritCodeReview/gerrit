You can easily check those out from the version the bottom of the Gerrit screen.\n\n@brohlfs@google.com which sites should be monitor? gerrit-review? chromium-review? others?",

      "message": "Yes, FE and BE rollouts are completely separate for Google hosted Gerrit.\n\nFE is released twice a week: Mon and Wed on gerrit-review. Tue and Thu on all other hosts.\n\nBE rollout is somewhat less frequent and less stable. Currently on prod we have the Oct24 rollout, but today have started rolling out a Oct29 build.\n\nTypically I would wait 2 weeks after submitting a BE change. Then you can ping me with the BE change numbers. I will check which release they are included in and if/when they have been rolled out. Ideally we have to wait 1 week after the release for being sure that the release is rollback safe.",
