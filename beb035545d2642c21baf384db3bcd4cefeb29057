      "message": "I think if you want to truly make npm binaries part of the Bazel BUILD, then you would rather have to look into tools/bzl/js.bzl and use the npm_binary rule or something similar.  Depending on node_modules/... would always require the user or CI system to have to run \"npm install\" first.\n\nAlternatively, you could just make the \"npm install\" part of the \"polylint_test.sh\" script and forget about the dependency in the Blaze BUILD rules.",
