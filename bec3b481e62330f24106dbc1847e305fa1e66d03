I don\u0027t see a real use-case for this, but if there is any, this can be added in another change. E.g. if I give -1 in Code-Review it could be due to an issue in the code or due to a comment about the commit message. If now a trivial rebase is done and the commit message is edited, it would be wrong to keep the -1 if it was due to the commit message.",
