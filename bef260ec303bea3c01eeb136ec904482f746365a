      "message": "I looked in our contribution guide docs [1] and I didn\u0027t see an answer there, but I\u0027m curious if we have any expectations on how long changes should remain open before being submitted. I think I\u0027ve generally operated under the idea that giving 24 hours for folks in different time zones to see the change is the polite thing to do, but I realize now that\u0027s not clearly stated in our process docs. Should we have something like that in the docs?\n\nI\u0027m asking on this change because I noticed its time from upload to submit was less than 3 hours.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-contributing.html",
