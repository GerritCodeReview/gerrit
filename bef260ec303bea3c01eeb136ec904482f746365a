I do remember that we have discussed this before (although I couldn\u0027t find the discussion, maybe it was at a hackathon?) and considered keeping changes open for at least 24h. I believe we were concerned about velocity already back then, which is why we didn\u0027t follow up on this idea.\n\nIf issues are found after a change has been submitted, addressing them in a follow-up change or doing a revert, is pretty easy and worked quite well for us so far. So maybe such a rule wouldn\u0027t give us that much benefit over how we handle this now.\n\n\u003e I\u0027ll put it on the agenda for ESC.\nThanks Han-Wen. It\u0027s good to discuss this again!
