      "message": "Today in our team meeting (Alice, Chang-Cheng, Han-Wen, Edwin) we have discussed again about vote squashing and we came to the conclusion that we are all favour this proposal.\n\nThe main advantage that we see with this solution is that it is least surprising to users.\nIt can be explained to users as simple as:\n\"When a change is moved veto votes are preserved and all other votes are removed\".\n\nKeeping veto votes is important since they prevent submit and it should not be possible to remove them by moving a change back and forth.\n\nThe other advantage of proposal 3 is that its implementation is easy (no vote squashing).\n\nGenrally we think that changing the votes on move (by squashing/unsquashing or by tieing votes to a branch) may confuse users since by looking at a change they can\u0027t tell how the votes will look after a move.",

      "message": "I am ok with this, at least until we have actual users whose actual workflows are actively hampered by this. (Not just hypothetical users who might have theoretical workflows--sorry Martin.) It also has the advantage that not requiring a change to the data model means we can easily change the behavior later.\n\nOne nit, however...\"minimum\" and \"veto\" votes are not the same thing. A -2 on a label doesn\u0027t block submission unless the function is *WithBlock. Is the proposal to leave -2s even on NoOp labels? That would be simpler to explain and implement (no need to check the label config), but doesn\u0027t match the rationale we\u0027re giving.",
