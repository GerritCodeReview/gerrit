Brandon Weeks from Google is working on upgrading BC to 1.69 and then to 1.72 (see [1]).\n\nWhat\u0027s confusing us is that as Matthias pointed out on this change, Bouncycastle 1.69 added bcutil as a new artefact which bcpkix depends on, but [1] is building successfully without adding this dependency. Matthias, do you know why this is and whether [1] should still add the bcutil dependency?\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/349334",
