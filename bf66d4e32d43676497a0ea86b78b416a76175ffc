I think we should keep this change, exactly because of the process we refer to above, but then I should move it to the master branch instead. I propose so because of stable-3.3 having been cut out already; see [1,2,3] below -taken from that process of ours.\n\n[1] \"(...) right after a new Gerrit release was branched off, all libraries should be upgraded to the latest version to prevent Gerrit from falling behind.\"\n\n[2] \"Doing those upgrades should conclude at the latest two months after the branch was cut.\"\n\n[3] \"This should happen on the master branch to ensure that they are vetted long enough before they go into a release and we can be sure that the update doesnâ€™t introduce a regression.\"",
