I thought I tested using the old key type along with new ones and it worked.\n\nThere is a small Java program in that thread for doing the conversion. For my own upgrades, I am using an Ansible playbook which uses that program to convert the old host key.\n\nI suppose we could basically use that conversion code inside of gerrit. I\u0027m guessing it should go into java/com/google/gerrit/pgm/init/InitSshd.java.",

A responsible Gerrit admin *must* rotate those keys and, when he does it, the clients will have to trust again the new key.\n\nConverting automatically the old obsolete keys into OpenSSH format is just hiding a bigger problem: the keys are unusable anyway. *IF* the Gerrit admin wants to do it, he has to do it consciously, and Gerrit shouldn\u0027t do it automatically.\n\nHope that makes sense.",
