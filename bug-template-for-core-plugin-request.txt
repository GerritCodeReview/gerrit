Description:
Please provide as much of the following information as possible (also see
https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-core-plugins#criteria):

1. URL to plugin repo (If not on gerrit-review, is it OK to move it to
gerrit-review?):

2. URL to the plugin license (must be Apache License Version 2.0):

3. Plugin Scope (describe which functionality the plugin provides and how
it integrates with Gerrit core, does it conflict with any functionality
from Gerrit core or other core plugins?):

4. Related Plugins (other plugins that provide similar functionality):

4a. Why is this plugin preferred over the other plugins?

5. Relevance (explain why this plugin is relevant to a majority of the
Gerrit community):

6. Existing Users (Which parties/organizations/companies already use the
plugin? If known, since when and how many users?):

7. Code Quality: (Are there any known issues? Does the code
adhere to Gerrit's quality standards? What's the expected maintenance
overhead for the maintainers?):

8. Scalability/Performance (How well does the plugin functionality scale
for large repos and hosts with many repos? How does it affect latency of user
requests?):

9. Test Coverage (How good is the test coverage? Which
functionality is not covered by tests? If there are missing tests, is there a
documented manual test plan?):

10. Plugin documentation (provide a link to the plugin documentation and
point out things that are not properly documented):

11. Ongoing/Planned Work (Are there larger features that are in-progress or
planned? Preferably provide links to issues in Monorail.):

12. Do the current plugin owners agree to transfer the plugin ownership to
the ESC (of cource any contributions from them continue to be welcome)?

(Note to ESC: Keep this issue open for at least 10 calendar days so that
everyone in the community has a chance to raise concerns.)
