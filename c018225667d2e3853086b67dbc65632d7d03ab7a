      "message": "For all the other extension points, we only have one place (typically at the\nbottom of the element). Like the `commit-containter`, or the `settings-screen`\nextension points. So having one place for the related changes list seems\nnatural to me, and having a `top` and a `bottom` would not fit the scheme.\n\nBut then: one might start such a new norm of having `top` and `bottom` extension\npoints. I\u0027m totally not sure. For this use-case, a single extension would do.\n\nIf you say, we want `top` and `bottom`. That\u0027s fine by me. Let me know and I\u0027ll add\nthem tomorrow.",
