For example gr-diff could be re-written in some way, then it would be good to know what consumers expect from this event.\n\nMaybe just move this call into _renderDiffTable() (line 866?), because this is just a 0 ms debounce. Do you really need multiple events when this is called multiple times in one microtask? If yes, then add a comment explaining why.\n\nMaybe rename the event from `render-required` to `render-started`?",
