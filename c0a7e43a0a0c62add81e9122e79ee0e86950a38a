Split that change to single changes per EP bug pattern?\n\nNote, that this change is updating to Bazel release candidate 5.0.rc3, and we should wait with the Bazel upgrade until final release 5.0 is shipped.",

      "message": "Our process for fixing the error prone issues was:\n\n1. Enable all new checks on error level that were not present in the code base and\n   add all other checks as comment in tools/BUILD.\n   \n2. File one issue for each check that is commented out and needs fixes.\n\n3. Process these issues one by one, which means having 1 change per error prone\n   check that gets fixed and enabled (in some cases where fixing needed to touch\n   a lot of code we also had several changes for 1 error prone check).\n   \nIf you already have the fix implemented, you may skip filing an issue and just upload the change, but I think one change per error prone fix would be nice.\n\nThanks for looking into this!",
