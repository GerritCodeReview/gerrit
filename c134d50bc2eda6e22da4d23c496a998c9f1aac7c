      "message": "Since this change is already merged in the master branch, I think we should just accept it as is for the stable-2.3 branch. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s good to modify an already merged change when it is cherry-picked to another branch. I\u0027ve now pushed a change to master [that fixes this spelling mistake [1]. Once it gets merged there, i\u0027ll cherry-pick it to stable-2.3 so that this issue is also fixed here.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/34430",
