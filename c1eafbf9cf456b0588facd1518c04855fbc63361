      "message": "Brilliant! That was easier than expected. :-)\n\nThe license check fails (as expected). Would be great to fix that (by adding a LICENSE file for MWC). Let me or Dmitrii know if you need help with that.\n\nI think it would be nice to find one (or a few) places where we can actually use and submit MWC components. Maybe on some less prominent admin or settings page? Then we can make sure the BUILD is fine, also Google internally.\n\nOnce that is done we could enter the next phase, which would be planning the actual migration. What needs to be done? What are the difficulties? How will the theming/styling of MWC components work for us?\n\nFeel free to go as far as you like with this, depending on how much time you have this quarter and how passionate you are about this. :-)",

      "message": "SGTM. I believe I have arranged the license stuff, but worth a quick look.\n\nI added an import \u0027@material/mwc-textfield\u0027; to gr-create-group-dialog component. Locally I see it is loading the mwc files but not using the component yet since it looks much different by default and I was not sure what styling to add. I think this should let us test the BUILD/release stuff and then start planning for the usage.",
