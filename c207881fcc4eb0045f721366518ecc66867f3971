      "message": "It took me two or three readings to understand what you meant here. A user does not expect a hyperlink such as:\n\n  \u003ca href\u003d\"#\" javascript\u003d\"doDelete()\"\u003eDelete\u003c/a\u003e\n\nand so this should not be a link. Instead, it should be a button. Can we spell out the use of hyperlinks vs. buttons vs. checkboxes vs. radio buttons vs. popup/select lists better?\n\nIts certainly tempting in some web UIs to use hyperlinks in bad ways; I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve done it more times than I can count. They can save space and are certainly easy to use. But I think what you are striving for here is hyperlinks should be reserved for navigational use; moving to another view, and maybe in limited circumstances expanding an existing view with \"Show more\" or \"Next\". While buttons should be used for actions that cause a change in the system that cannot be restored by simply clicking the browser\u0027s \"Back\" button.",
