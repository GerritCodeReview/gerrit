      "message": "FWIW, primary and secondary are existing concepts for button styles (primary buttons are blue and secondary buttons are red).\n\n\u003e An action which is important for a specific workflow\n\nI wonder if this definition is too broad. For tools like Gerrit, it can seem like *every* control is important for *somebody\u0027s* workflow. I\u0027m not sure I could say which actions are definitely Secondary in light of this definition of Primary.",

      "message": "It took me two or three readings to understand what you meant here. A user does not expect a hyperlink such as:\n\n  \u003ca href\u003d\"#\" javascript\u003d\"doDelete()\"\u003eDelete\u003c/a\u003e\n\nand so this should not be a link. Instead, it should be a button. Can we spell out the use of hyperlinks vs. buttons vs. checkboxes vs. radio buttons vs. popup/select lists better?\n\nIts certainly tempting in some web UIs to use hyperlinks in bad ways; I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve done it more times than I can count. They can save space and are certainly easy to use. But I think what you are striving for here is hyperlinks should be reserved for navigational use; moving to another view, and maybe in limited circumstances expanding an existing view with \"Show more\" or \"Next\". While buttons should be used for actions that cause a change in the system that cannot be restored by simply clicking the browser\u0027s \"Back\" button.",

      "message": "If we spell out the use of the different UI elements, we should probably introduce another document. Listing all of them here including descriptions for their use would disrupt the guideline. I think it would be a good idea to have such a document and to link to it from this paragraph. However, I would rather introduce it with another change as it will bring on further discussions. Maybe someone from the PolyGerrit team can help with its creation.\n\nRegarding the use of hyperlinks and buttons: I agree with you. I just didn\u0027t dare to restrict it like that because PolyGerrit wouldn\u0027t comply with it.",

      "message": "Totally agree with this point that UI elements should not have counterintuitive effects, but perhaps a different example should be used to illustrate it.\n\nWhile buttons should generally do-something and links should generally take-you-somewhere, there\u0027s still considerable gray area (e.g. the show more/show less links) and we might not want to set too strong a precedent by using it as the example here.\n\nIMO, casting the show more/show less links as secondary doesn\u0027t exactly capture why they feel appropriate as those controls. It\u0027s hard to characterize that distinction and it might have more to do with typography and managing visual noise or user attention.",
