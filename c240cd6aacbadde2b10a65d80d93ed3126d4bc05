The update requires some additional steps (https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases - \"update your @bazel-scoped npm dependencies.\").\n\nUsually, I am doing in 2 steps:\nyarn remove @bazel/... @bazel/... ... (all @bazel packages from package.json)\nyarn add @bazel/... ... (same packages)\n\nP.S. yarn upgrade has a problem with updating transitive dependencies",
