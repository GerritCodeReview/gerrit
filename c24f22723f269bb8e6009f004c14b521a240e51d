I realised I missed the plugin build documentation for buck, so I\u0027ll upload a new patch on that change too.\n\nI don\u0027t intend to update dev-release-subproject; that documentation refers to projects (gwtorm, gwtjsonrpc) that still use Maven to build.",

The process will be different depending on which platform you\u0027re running, and it\u0027s all documented on the links anyway.\n\nAlso I\u0027d rather not spend a lot of effort making this documentation perfect now, if maven is going to be removed later.  If it turns out that maven is kept, then that effort can be spent.",
