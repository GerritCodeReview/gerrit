WDYT?\n\nWe current have:\nSubmitRequirement (data structure that holds the result of an evaluation)\nSubmitRule (extension point for plugins)\n\nIn the new world, I would say we need:\nSubmitRequirementConfig (the config from project.config)\nSubmitRequirement (the result of an evaluation - we can further bikeshed the name o/c)\nSubmitRequirementAtom (extension point for plugins, returns SubmitRequirementAtom.Result with a boolean status and a list of actions along with a textual result description)\n\nHappy to discuss this more :-)",
