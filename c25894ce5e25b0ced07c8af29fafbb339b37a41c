WDYT?\n\nWe current have:\nSubmitRequirement (data structure that holds the result of an evaluation)\nSubmitRule (extension point for plugins)\n\nIn the new world, I would say we need:\nSubmitRequirementConfig (the config from project.config)\nSubmitRequirement (the result of an evaluation - we can further bikeshed the name o/c)\nSubmitRequirementAtom (extension point for plugins, returns SubmitRequirementAtom.Result with a boolean status and a list of actions along with a textual result description)\n\nHappy to discuss this more :-)",

      "message": "Thanks for discussing :) \n\nIn the old world, we also have SubmitRecord:\n  * SubmitRecord is the result of evaluating a submit rule (contains a List of SubmitRequirement - in old notation).\n\nIn the new world\n  1. I prefer using SubmitRequirement for the name + description + 3 conditions. We can use SubmitRequirementResult to store the result of the evaluation (boolean values of the evaluated expressions + a detailed evaluation of different atoms of the expressions, etc...).\n  2. Do we need SubmitRequirementConfig? Parsing the project config can return a Map of \u003cSR_name, SubmitRequirement\u003e (Using my notation of SubmitRequirement from [1]). Does this need a separate class?",
