Seems like Critique is using ten seconds before the snackbar disappears from the screen so I propose we use the same time.\n\nFrom Material specs https://material.io/components/snackbars#behavior \n\nAppearing and disappearing\n\nSnackbars appear without warning, and don\u0027t require user interaction. They automatically disappear from the screen after a minimum of four seconds, and a maximum of ten seconds.\n\n",
