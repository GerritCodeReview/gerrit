If they wanted a project name longer than 150 characters, their servers would support it, but the schema wouldn\u0027t by default because of this length declaration.\n\nI would prefer to truncate these columns elsewhere for MySQL users only.",

It\u0027s a long story, but the conclusion is if we can avoid imposing limits on anything affecting maximum length of the filesystem path, it\u0027s good thing.\n\nThanks. :-)",
