With this change the file list is now similar to how it was with the old change screen and for this screen I never heard that somebody wants to see more files when comparing patch sets after an rebase. If really needed we can add a user preference later, but doing it on a stable branch would be difficult. Adding a new user preference requires a schema migration, and there have been already schema migrations in master since stable-2.9 was branched off...",
