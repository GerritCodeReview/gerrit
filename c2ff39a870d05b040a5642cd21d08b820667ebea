      "message": "Maybe we could add some more details about the fixed security hole? Shawn described it in [1] like this:\n\n\"The identified security hole may permit a modified Git client to gain access to hidden or deleted branches if the user has read permission on at least one branch in the repository. Access requires knowing a SHA-1 to request, which may be discovered out-of-band from an issue tracker or gitweb instance.\"\n\n[1] https://groups.google.com/d/msg/repo-discuss/DaR64jwRhpI/VNaTGukpvsQJ",
