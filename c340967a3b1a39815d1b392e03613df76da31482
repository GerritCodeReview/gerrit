      "message": "I don\u0027t think that this is going to be a sustainable approach to pass in a new flag everytime we want to control whether a specific validation is performed.  I can\u0027t help but think that each one of these tests is really just a commitValidator.  So perhaps a better approach is to turn each one of the tests into a commitValidator (I am not sure that we can make that work with all the different parameters they might need)?  But if we had a bunch of commit validatiors, then each caller (receiveCommits and cherryPick) could just assemble a list of validators and then call them.  The actual validators would be defined outside of those 2 classes so that they could be shared.",
