      "message": "This section isn\u0027t really to do with the configuration of Gerrit, but rather configuration/extension of the JDK. Therefore it should be a part of the installation requirements/instructions[1] instead.\n\nMy suggestion is to create a new section between \"Requirements\" and \"Download Gerrit\" that\u0027s named \"Configure java for strong cryptography\" or similar.\n\nAlso, there could be a word or link on where these policy files should go in the JDK installation area as that\u0027s not very intuitive for someone who\u0027s never seen this before.\n\n[1] Documentation/install.html#requirements",
