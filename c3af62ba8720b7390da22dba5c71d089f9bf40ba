Why would we reset this here using a database operation (*Op are DB ops).\n\nThis whole flow will create a new change, right (\u003d a cherry pick of a commit). If we don\u0027t want to set cherryPickOf, we can just not set it instead of set it and then remove it. I feel I am missing something obvious here :-)",

      "message": "So this code path updates the existing change with the new patch set (cherry-pick of a commit). It will not result in creating a new change, see the tests I added:\ncherryPickCommitToExistingChange\ncherryPickCommitToExistingCherryPickedChange\n\nPreviously, it would always result in NPE.\n\nFor the new changes, we just don\u0027t set cherry-pick of.\nI suggest to reset the cherry pick of in case we update the existing change.\n* If the user wants to keep the relation, they can use https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#cherry-pick to provide the source change\n* Otherwise, the source change is not provided, but they want to update existing destination.\n* If we don\u0027t reset it, we will end up with the old value from the previous patch set.\n* This is consistent with the API behaviour for new changes (no cherry-pick of set).",
