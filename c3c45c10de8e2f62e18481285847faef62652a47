If we drop the flag in 2.11/3.0 clients that send \u0026force in the query will fail hard.\n\nDo we want to remove the flag, mark it deprecated in the docs, but silently accept and ignore the flag for a few releases?\n\nOr is it safe to assume this flag is probably not widely used and its OK to fail hard when a server upgrades to from 2.9 or 2.10 to 2.11 and the flag is removed?",
