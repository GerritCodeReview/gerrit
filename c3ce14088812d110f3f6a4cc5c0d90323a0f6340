      "message": "Because TypeScript compiler produced an error for line 474 otherwise: You cannot spread something undefined and have the value be `EditablePermissionRuleInfo`.\n\nI was considering to create an if-else statement for `this.rule.value \u003d ...`, but thinking about it that did not really make a lot of sense. We could probably add an assertion that `originalRuleValues` is defined, but I did not really dare to do that.\n\nOverall I find this component is not very well written with regards to `rule`, `originalRuleValues` and default rule values. But I think I have already done more than worthwhile to this component as is. So I am leaving this to the next one refactoring the component. :-)",
