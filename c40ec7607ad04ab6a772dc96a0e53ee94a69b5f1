      "message": "I disagree. New settings for SBS2 should be there where all other prefs for SBS2 reside: on DiffPreferences screeen. Inline edit series moves already editing of commit message to Edit Screen (similar to SBS2), also Codemirror editor. Also note, that user may want to experiment with the setting to find what match best her expectation. Taht why we seamlessly support application of properties, with or without persisting them in the database (and Git later):\n\n* open SBS2\n* push comma\n* change setting\n* push apply\n\nYou see that your changes were activated even with closing the rpeferences screen. You just can have that comfort, if you would require to leave the screen to my preferences change that and come back to trealize that you aren\u0027t satisfied with made changes.",

      "message": "Makes sense for the SBS2. But what about the commit message in ChangeScreen2? How do users know that they have to open some diff in order to change the text size in the ChangeScreen2? Or should it be a separate preference? Or is it not so important?",

      "message": "Commit message popup editor is the old way that was invented before inline edit series. In a perfect word, Edit Message button sholdn\u0027t ven exist:\n\n* create a edit\n* click on commit message link\n* change edit screen is opened\n* edit message\n* click on settings for edit screen\n* change/apply/save them \n* continue editing commit message in CM3\n* save\n* publish change edit\n\nFor backwards compatibility and not to introduce disruptive UI changes we decided to preserve Edit Message button with old popup dialog, but hijacked it to inline edit workflow, see [1] for fiscussion on this topic. But in any event i would just ignore eny styles/fonts in popup dialog and only apply them on editing in CM3. E. g. how would you implement show line number in popup dialog that only uses normal textarea? Note, that de scenario described above isn\u0027t merged yet, but the inline-3 series is still under developments [2].\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/61114\n* [2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+topic:inline-3",

The way to go is: \n\n* 1. intrduce new prferences for edit screen and store them first time in AllUsers repository, done in [2]\n* 2. migrate all existing setting to AlUsers repo\n* 3. introduce new setting and store them direct in Git\n\nLinks:\n\n* [1] https://groups.google.com/d/topic/repo-discuss/bX36w565m7c/discussion\n* [2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/61601",
