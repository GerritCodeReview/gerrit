      "message": "\u003e - The download-commands plugin is pretty odd, its configuration is in core and implementation in a plugin, why that?\n\nIt should come from the fact that download-commands was a core functionality first and I think the idea was that there would be a plethora of `download-command` plugins that could read the same config.\nIf you ask me it feels like an anti-pattern and the download configuration should be in the plugin only.\n\u003e - It might be useful to also show the extended clone command including commit-msg hook and configuration of remote.origin.pushUrl in gitiles.\n\nIf that comes into fruition we could move the configuration into core, or they could read the configuration separately.\n\u003e - We could create a branch stable-3.9 and make the maintenance branches use that\n\nI vote for reading this configuration in the plugin instead, I don\u0027t see anything gained by reading it in core. (If you ask me all other download-specific configuration such as `DownloadConfig` should move into the plugin as well but that might be a breaking change if there are alternative download plugins out in the wild that uses it).\n\nWe could document it in core as a config options possibly read by plugins that construct ssh URLs and a list of plugins that currently read it?",
