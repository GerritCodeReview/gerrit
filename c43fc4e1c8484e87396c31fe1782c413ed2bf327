I would much prefer the plugin-specific config (i.e. `[plugin \"download-commands\"]` or `$site_dir/etc/download-commands.config`) in the plugin as that\u0027s consistent with all other plugins.\n\n\u003e \u003e - It might be useful to also show the extended clone command including commit-msg hook and configuration of remote.origin.pushUrl in gitiles.\n\u003e \n\u003e If that comes into fruition we could move the configuration into core, or they could read the configuration separately.\n\nOr gitiles could even depend on download-commands to provide it now that we have a documented cross-plugin dependency framework.\n\n\u003e \u003e - We could create a branch stable-3.9 and make the maintenance branches use that\n\u003e \n\u003e I vote for reading this configuration in the plugin instead, I don\u0027t see anything gained by reading it in core. (If you ask me all other download-specific configuration such as `DownloadConfig` should move into the plugin as well but that might be a breaking change if there are alternative download plugins out in the wild that uses it).\n\nI\u0027m less sure what to do about configs that are outside of the download-commands plugin namespace. It\u0027s a less common pattern to have a plugin owning a config that looks like a core config. Renaming this config to `plugin.download-commands.sshd-advertisedPrimary` and moving it to the plugin would solve that, but it feels a little strange.",
