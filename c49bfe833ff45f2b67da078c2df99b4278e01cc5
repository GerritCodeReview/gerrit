If I understand what you are trying to do, I would word it as: you are factoring our MERGE_IF_NECESSARY from all sub projects and deciding that such projects will no longer have an explicit strategy, but instead they will now inherit their strategy from \"-- All Projects --\".  Did I get that right?\n\nI so, I do not think that this is a good assumption.  None of the other strategy styles will suddenly inherit their merge strategies after this conversion.  I think that it would be better to provide a script to perform this type of conversion if it is deemed valuable than to simply assume that admins want this conversion and to provide it only for the M case.\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t like the idea of tweaking an old schema to alter functionality.  I think that the only valid reason to alter an older schema is likely because the code base has changed and it prevents the old schema update from working (perhaps even compiling) exactly the way it used to work.  As is, users who have  already upgraded past schema53 before this change ever gets merged will not see the above functionality and their upgrade would be quite different than if they had waited until this change got merged as is.",
