      "message": "Whenever the user registers a new e-mail address this e-mail address will now automatically get the preferred e-mail address of the user. I think it would be better to do the save only for the first e-mail address that is registered. This means the first registered e-mail address automatically gets the preferred e-mail address, but if any further e-mail address is registered the preferred e-mail address should not be changed unless the user explicitly clicks on the \u0027Save Changes\u0027 button. Basically as it was in patch set 4:\n\nif (emailPick.getItemCount() \u003d\u003d 0) {\n   // the first e-mail address that is registered automatically\n   // becomes the preferred e-mail address\n   onSaveSuccess(currentUser);\n } else {\n   // an additional e-mail address was registered,\n   // the user has to click on \u0027Save Changes\u0027 to make it the\n   // preferred one\n   save.setEnabled(true);\n }",
