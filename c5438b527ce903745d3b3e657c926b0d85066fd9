I think this is fine and the approval copying will work as expected, but would appreciate your input on this.",

I think it would be nice though to have one basic test (have a chain with \u003e\u003d2 changes, have a copyable approval on each of them, rebase the chain, check that the approvals have been copied correctly).",
