      "message": "I think we may want to support a local m2 repository cache eventually. Right now, how do we handle a locally-built version of e.g. JGit? Just change your BUCK files to point to file://path/to/jgit.jar? And the performance gain from not hitting the network (particularly if it\u0027s slow) may be significant. Since we\u0027re checking the SHA-1 of the file it won\u0027t affect correctness.\n\nYes, it\u0027s easy to poison your cache if someone forgets to bump a version number in an upstream pom.xml, but that\u0027s why we\u0027re checking the SHA-1. We could even make it so that if the cache is corrupted (cached a false negative or has the wrong SHA-1) it silently tries again on the network.",
