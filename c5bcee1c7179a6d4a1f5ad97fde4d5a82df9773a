      "message": "It\u0027s 3*_fileListIncrement. 4*_fileListIncrement caused severe UI slowdowns and sometimes caused the 429 error if I used the action too quickly in succession. I really just eyeballed it, but it seems like a good number. I think we should use it for now and tweak it further if people want more functionality or more problems are encountered.",

      "message": "For 1 - obviously the speed at which all of the diffs load is constrained by what\u0027s in them as well as how many of them there are. This is the number that seems low enough to avoid the 429 error... I could foresee a use case where someone wants to expand a moderate amount of files and cmd+f to find something within them.\n\nAs for 2, It\u0027s declared as a readOnly prop so that I can reference it in the test and still be able to change the constant if it needs tweaking, as well as for synergy with the way I defined another constant in this file.",
