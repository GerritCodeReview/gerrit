I think it would be worth pursuing a per request scope form of caching instead of a time based one. In other words, it would be better to always read this value at least once at the beginning of the request to ensure that it is up-to-date, and then use that value throughout the entire request so that it is not only faster, but consistent throughout the request. We use this technique for many of our plugin predicates. It provides a good balance between data correctness and speed, and I think it might apply well to this problem.",

As others have pointed out, there are also the multi-primary use cases to care about. \n\n\u003e Having said that I\u0027m still open for more suggestions - can you point me to an example of such scope limited cache?\n\nThe examples I am familiar with do not use Guice or Guava for this. Any predicate which sets or looks up data either lazily, or in its constructor is effectively caching via a small scope. The task plugin caches a lot of task data in the TaskTree object which gets created once per query, but then reused for every change.\n\nThis use case might be more complicated, you could try passing a Cache object around to all the places it is used, but using Guice to do this would likely be better. I am imagining using Guice\u0027s @RequestScoped annotation to bind a cache class that represents this cache, and then injecting that cache wherever it is needed. This cache object could probably be as simple as a HashMap which knows how to lookup up values in the AllUsers project on \"misses\" (very similar to what you have, but without guava).\n\n\u003e But IMHO it will still create the bottleneck for the busy servers as scopes will still compete on getting the same ref object ids (`refs/meta/external-ids` and `refs/users/default`) and it is a matter of load then...\n\nThat could be, can you quantify this with numbers such as \"load average drops by X percent with this cache\"?",
