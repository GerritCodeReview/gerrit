      "message": "I am not familiar with Oauth in Gerrit and thus can also not say much. @david.ostrovsky@gmail.com might know more about it.\n\nHowever, I am not sure whether doing what you suggest would be safe. There are no guarantees that the usernames in LDAP and OAuth map to the same person. If that is not the case, somebody could get access to somebody else\u0027s account. At the very least, we should compare the emails, which are more unique identifiers and also used as the \"primary keys\" for accounts in Gerrit. Since emails are also used by git to identify authors and committers, this would be the most important identifier. I.e. do not only check whether the username already exists, but also whether the primary email matches as well. This still requires us to assume that the OAuth provider verifies the emails of users, but that should be acceptable I guess.",

      "message": "SO the main issue here is that when a user is signed up with LDAP the have the email on thei LDAP account. When we go to sign in through OAuth it will then error as the e-mail will be used. Now we can always delete this e-mail no problem, but then we will get another error as it will try to receate the `username:\u003cuser\u003e` external ID.\n\nWhat this code does is it still requirese the user to manually delete the LDAP email associated, but it will then allow the user to login by resuing their username:\u003cuser\u003e external ID. If we did not do it this way then when we are transitioned for LDAP to OAUTH all user history is deleted which does not seem desirable.\n\nSo going back to what you said, you are suggesting is that when signing in, we check if the e-mail is already associatd with another externa-ID and if so we reuse that account ID and delete that e-mail for that other external ID?",

      "message": "Thomas I have changed this to the following, if it is an OAuth login the check if there is an external ID with that e-mail present. If so remove the e-mail from that other external ID and add it to the new one. If it does not then it will create a new external ID with that e-mail. Does that satisfy your security concerns. There is no need to check username at this point as the e-mail is the account we want to link to.",

      "message": "Ok. I understand your issue a little bit better now. And I certainly agree that we should enable this scenario.\n\nSince I am not familiar with the OAuth implementation, I have a small knowledge gap here. Maybe you can help me with that. According to your description, username and email are the same for each user in both identity providers. Thus, both systems should be able to directly map the users to Gerrit. Some time ago we migrated from LDAP to SAL and this just worked (except that we had to make usernames case insensitive). Users were just able to keep their accounts. Thus, I ask myself why this is not working for you? Could you provide me with examples of sets of external IDs, one of a LDAP account and one of an OAuth account?\nI would expect that the `username:` and `mailto:` external IDs are the same and that their are additional ones related to the IDP, e.g. `gerrit:` for LDAP. Am I correct?",
