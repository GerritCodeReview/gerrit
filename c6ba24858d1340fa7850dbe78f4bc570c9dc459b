      "message": "The list below seems to be some of the things you are trying to address with this proposed solution. Since priorities and perceptions about relative painpoints of issues like these are likely to be very different across very different segments of the community, it feels inappropriate to propose such a massive change as this to address them. It would be helpful to break this change into independent changes to address individual problems/issues so that specific solutions can be evaluated against specific problems to see if they would likely address the specific problems, and if they don\u0027t cause significant new problems of their own. Some sample individual problems and suggested solutions (some possibly terrible) might be:\n\n* project vision: \n  -Have individual maintainers express and write down their current visions, on blogs, on mailing list, at conferences.\n  -See if there is consensus on some of those visions and if so, consider formalizing those visions with a consensus, also consider documenting where there might be disagreement regularly (and why) so that people at least understand when certain issues might be more controversial.\n  -...?\n\n* project scope:\n  -Similar to above...\n  -Document what Shawn may have said in the past about this.\n  -...?\n\n* roadmap:\n  -Ask current large contributors to document where they believe they might spend their time in the next year or two.\n  -Seek input from users via bug trackers, mailing list, and conferences\n  -...?\n\n* release plan (I am not quite sure what this represents?):\n  -Ask individual maintainers what they might be willing to commit to doing with respect to releases.\n  -Ask users what it would take for them to upgrade to newer releases?\n  -Ask users how often they upgrade, and why they upgrade, why their specific schedule, what are the problems they encounter?\n  -Ask users how often they could potentially upgrade?\n  -Ask users if they don\u0027t use stable releases why?\n  -...?\n\n* prioritized backlog\n  -Contribute bug reports, testing, code and bug fixes for the things that you feel should be prioritized\n  -Propose reverts for code that breaks stuff\n  -...?",

We just re-confirmed that maintainers have *no responsibilities* [1], so if maintainers are not responsible for this, who then?\nOur answer is, that there should be a steering committee, whose members are committed to take care of these kind of topics.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/222153/11/Documentation/dev-roles.txt#140",

Small incremental changes has no added benefit if you haven\u0027t defined what you are changing. The correct software analogy to small changes in this case would not be small source-code deltas but rather flipping random bits in a binary.\n\nThis proposal is a big change, but it\u0027s not a big change from one process to a completely different process, it is a big change precisely because it\u0027s a change from no process to a defined process.\nThe main concern here is not whether this is a valid replacement of an already existing process, but *is this a good starting point for the effort to get to a working process*.\nOnce there\u0027s an agreement on a good starting point, and that process has been tried for some time, then we can start making small incremental changes in order to fine-tune it.",

These changes are setting the big frame: Agree that we want to have a steering committee, a design driven process, mentorships and a community manager. Once agreed, many of the process details and the contents still need to be defined/refined in an iterative process. This iterative process should be driven by the steering committee, but of course the whole community should be involved. These are the topics that we want to discuss and get started at the hackathon.",
