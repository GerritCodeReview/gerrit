      "message": "The list below seems to be some of the things you are trying to address with this proposed solution. Since priorities and perceptions about relative painpoints of issues like these are likely to be very different across very different segments of the community, it feels inappropriate to propose such a massive change as this to address them. It would be helpful to break this change into independent changes to address individual problems/issues so that specific solutions can be evaluated against specific problems to see if they would likely address the specific problems, and if they don\u0027t cause significant new problems of their own. Some sample individual problems and suggested solutions (some possibly terrible) might be:\n\n* project vision: \n  -Have individual maintainers express and write down their current visions, on blogs, on mailing list, at conferences.\n  -See if there is consensus on some of those visions and if so, consider formalizing those visions with a consensus, also consider documenting where there might be disagreement regularly (and why) so that people at least understand when certain issues might be more controversial.\n  -...?\n\n* project scope:\n  -Similar to above...\n  -Document what Shawn may have said in the past about this.\n  -...?\n\n* roadmap:\n  -Ask current large contributors to document where they believe they might spend their time in the next year or two.\n  -Seek input from users via bug trackers, mailing list, and conferences\n  -...?\n\n* release plan (I am not quite sure what this represents?):\n  -Ask individual maintainers what they might be willing to commit to doing with respect to releases.\n  -Ask users what it would take for them to upgrade to newer releases?\n  -Ask users how often they upgrade, and why they upgrade, why their specific schedule, what are the problems they encounter?\n  -Ask users how often they could potentially upgrade?\n  -Ask users if they don\u0027t use stable releases why?\n  -...?\n\n* prioritized backlog\n  -Contribute bug reports, testing, code and bug fixes for the things that you feel should be prioritized\n  -Propose reverts for code that breaks stuff\n  -...?",

These changes are setting the big frame: Agree that we want to have a steering committee, a design driven process, mentorships and a community manager. Once agreed, many of the process details and the contents still need to be defined/refined in an iterative process. This iterative process should be driven by the steering committee, but of course the whole community should be involved.

Unless we create an entity that sits over the SC, it would be up to the SC to decide on your complaint.\n\nI believe the community manager is the role to resolve such situations if I have understood correctly its role.\n\n\u003e As a practical example: the FE team was reorganized end of last year, and we had to bring new people into the project. They were unknown to the community. We didn\u0027t have the SC, but we did have maintainership, and we made them maintainers, because it was the only way to get the UI/FE work moving again.

Could you propose something?\n\nWhat about \"appointed by Google, amongst its maintainers\" would suffice I believe.\n\nThat leaves complete freedom for Google to chose whoever is appropriate for you or whoever will be in the future in your position. At the same time gives the guarantee to the community that the person sitting in the ESC is a maintainer, which all the skills and experience involved in that role.\n\nWhat do you think?",
