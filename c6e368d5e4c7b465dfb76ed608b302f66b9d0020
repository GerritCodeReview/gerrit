      "message": "How were you able to narrow it down to this line?\n\nI ran the tests for this element and the gr-js-api-interface in an interactive test session and all tests worked fine. I also tried to run them locally with `npm run test` and it timed out. I checked out the current tip of the stable-2.16 branch and tried again, but it also timed out. So my local system may be somehow broken. That of course makes it hard to find out what is happening here.",
