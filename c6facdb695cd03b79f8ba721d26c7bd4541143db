We definitely do not have a test going into an infinite loop on stable-2.14 but that does not mean the problem could not happen.\n\nAccording to Caffeine documentation, the loader must NOT attempt to update any mappings of its cache directly. In PatchListLoader, we call patchListCache.get which will cause an update to the cache if value is not present in the cache.",

      "message": "Removing this circular dependency is not easy. When we are loading a patchset, to exclude the files that changed because of rebase, we need to retrieve other patchset from the cache.\n\nI see no simple way to remove that circular dependency. I hate to say that but maybe Caffeine is not such a good idea after all...\n\nShould I do the revert on stable-2.14 instead. The last thing I want is to introduce a regression trying to fix a bug it seems I am the only to face.",
