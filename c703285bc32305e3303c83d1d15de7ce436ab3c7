      "message": "While I agree it\u0027s ugly, that is the intended resulting URL. We can change that too though! Although it\u0027s not so easy.\n\nBecause Gerrit uses a custom URL encoding scheme where plus is mapped to space, if we used something like \"test++test\", then there would be no way to distinguish a change in that repository from a change in a repository named \"test  test\".\n\nIt\u0027s good to think about how good the URLs look, but at least with this fix the changes can be loaded. I\u0027ll add this context to the issue.",
