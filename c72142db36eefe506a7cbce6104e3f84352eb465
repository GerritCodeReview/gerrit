      "message": "Yes, that would also have been my reply to your last comment. First of all, I don\u0027t think that anybody is relying on logs only being sent to stderr in production. For me this looks rather like a development feature right now. In this context, writing a few logs to the harddrive by default shouldn\u0027t be an issue, especially it is easy to switch off. Thus, I think while this is in general maybe a breaking change, I would consider it a minor issue and would personally feel safe to add it to 3.0, if nobody else has any concerns.\nIf I understood Shawn\u0027s commit message [1] of when he added this correctly, this was the default mode in the beginning and file based logging was added only later.  This flag was basically a compatibility option.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/12575",
