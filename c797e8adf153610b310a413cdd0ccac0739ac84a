      "message": "I thought about the name like that, but I didn\u0027t like it, because:\n\n1) The name needs to indicate that you are grabbing a promise of a latest suggestion task. It\u0027s not the only one, it\u0027s not even the only one active (though I intend to fix that). There will be next ones\n2) If it doesn\u0027t mention suggestions in the names, than it\u0027s hard to tell what it means without knowing internals of autocomplete.\n\nI renamed in a getter way though, so changed to latestSuggestionsUpdateComplete",
