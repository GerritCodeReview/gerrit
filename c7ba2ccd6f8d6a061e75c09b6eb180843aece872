      "message": "To be clear, I think we should submit this change as-is, but I\u0027m not particularly persuaded by this argument.\n\nThe complexity we have today is already problematic: we claim that permissions are based on ref patterns, so it\u0027s reasonable for users to believe that setting a permission on a particular ref name would, you know, grant permissions on that ref. But that\u0027s not the case today, due to the weird special-casing of tags (to say nothing of the refs/for/refs/heads/* mess). We already have evidence that this is confusing users.\n\nThis change arguably makes it worse, because we\u0027re adding another special-case behavior to refs/*. But not for other equivalent ref patterns, e.g. refs/.*. So the cognitive load is still there.",
