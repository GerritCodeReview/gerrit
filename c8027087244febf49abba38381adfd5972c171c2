      "message": "The `next` middleware (the base I guess?) is actually loading the file from disk, so I want to override the loaded body with our fake body. For example, context.body is `undefined` before `next()` is done. I tested it with the override before `next` and it does appear that the base middleware is respecting that body already exists and does not overwrite it, but I think conceptually it\u0027s clearer this way (\"mess with request/url on the way down the middleware stack. mess with response/status on the way up\") and seems to match the style from the koa website and code snippets I have seen.",
