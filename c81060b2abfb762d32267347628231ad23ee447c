      "message": "The difference is:\n\n- if you use a regular expression to search changes, the query is processed by the index backend which (in our case) doesn\u0027t support regular expressions\n\n- if you use a regular expression as part of a submit requirement it\u0027s Gerrit who checks whether a given change matches that query (no index backend involved) and Gerrit does support regular expressions in queries (FYI I think it\u0027s the same for project watches)",
