I don\u0027t quite know what it changes but from the console log I can see that it now iterates properly across the event targets.\n\nI have send the patch for 3.3: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/313923 (I could not figure out how to make it a merge since the file got renamed).\n\nThere is still an issue that keyboard shorcuts are not suppressed while in a reply dialog and emitting the event on the iron overlay, the event is somehow considered to target body. But that is an entirely different issue ;)",
