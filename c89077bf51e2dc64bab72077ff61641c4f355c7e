      "message": "Is naming accurate enough? If we are going to add yet another global capability for groups, and the limits can be set or unset or set differently then it should be reflected in the name of the capability:\n\n* listProjectsLimit\n* listGroupsLimit\n\nThe only alternative is to apply the new single list limit capability on both: projects and groups, in which case this should be probably done in this change? What about list accounts limits? We don\u0027t apply limit to this entity, because there are not that many accounts on a site as projects and groups?",

      "message": "If you use more general ListProjects class instead of SSH command \"ls-projects\" better communicate the intent that it\u0027s applied not only to SSH command, but also for REST API endpoint for GWT UI. If this change would be done on master, this wouldn\u0027t be true any more, as on PG UI, QueryProjects and not ListProjects is used, and QueryProjects is using secondary index, that is per default limited with 500.\n\nSo that there is potentially a conflicting setting, at least on master: QUERY_LIMIT and LIST_PROJECTS_LIMIT for the same thing, at least for REST API endpoint. If we would apply the same query_limit on SSH command, even though it\u0027s currently doesn\u0027t use QueryProjects we would be done, right?\n\nGerrit already has too many configuration options and before adding yet another couple of new options/capabilities, we should thoroughly consider the alternatives. The alternative to this change is to widen the application of query_limit on ListProjects in addition to QueryProjects (or even List groups). I see in the discussion of this change that you don\u0027t want to introduce new max default for new range capability because this change is on stable branch, so that from the same argumentation, we would need yet another obscure configuration option:\n\n  projects.apply_existing_max_query_limit_as_listing_limit\n\nthat would be false per default, at least on stable branch (and thus this change would be a no op) and possibly apply this new configuration option on both projects and groups listing.",
