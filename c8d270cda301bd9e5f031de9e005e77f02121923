      "message": "This still has one small issue: Setting preferred email for user while this email address is already the preferred mail. The REST endpoint is a no-op in this case:\n\n  if (rsrc.getEmail().equals(a.getPreferredEmail())) {\n      return Response.ok(\"\");\n  }\n\nSo i tend to ignore this case here as well. Alternative approach would be to check this here and issue a warning in this case. May be document this behavior in SSH command description that this is a no-op in this case?",
