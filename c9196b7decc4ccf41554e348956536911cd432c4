This means anything currently saved in local storage will be retrieved for a full line comment. there\u0027s a chance it could be a little wonky if they created it with a range comment, it was stored, and now try to create a full line comment. It will retrieve the draft as it would have before. Similarly, if they try to re-create the range, it will not populate. I believe this is the best tradeoff.",
