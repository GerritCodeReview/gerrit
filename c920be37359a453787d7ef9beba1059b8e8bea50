The urlProvider.get(req) method returns a string like:\n\n  https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/\n\nAfter URLEncode.encode() to make this string safe we have:\n\n  https%3a%2f%2fgerrit-review.googlesource.com%2f\n\nI know of no browser that can sanely follow that URL in a Location response header.\n\nHowever, since I don\u0027t use LDAP I\u0027m game for trying this and seeing if anyone who does complains when this ships in a release.",

If req.getRequestURI() contained \"/\", which it must as it should have at least \"/plugins/\" on it here, and ctx is \"/\" we now trim a single % from the start and are left with \"2fplugins%2f\".
