      "message": "\u003e note that CommitsCollection already does a visibility/reachability check on the commit, so you\u0027re doing double work here.\nYes, CommitsCollection does a visibility/reachability check on the commit. We would still need a check to filter the input refs based on the caller\u0027s visibility.(as we only did a check on commit in CommitsCollection)\n\n\u003e if performance is a concern, you\u0027d better make an endpoint on the projects/$PROJECT/ level.\nCould you elaborate on this..?",
