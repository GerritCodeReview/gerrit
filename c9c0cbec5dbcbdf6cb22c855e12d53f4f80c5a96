      "message": "The chain \"Migrate * to use new diff cache\" contains a list of callers that might rely in a way or another on the current behaviour of old/new paths for diffs. For now, I\u0027m focusing on preserving the same behaviour. Later on, we can revisit this logic, hence keeping a todo for myself.\n\nWhy not now?\n1) To avoid another source of uncertainty for the correctness of results.\n2) To speed-up rolling out the new diff cache, especially that this is not directly related to the new cache rollout. I can tackle other related/peripheral work after doing the migration.",
