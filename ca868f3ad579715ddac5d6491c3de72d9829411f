You can\u0027t submit only one patch set out of total N patch sets that are on the change.  Also you can\u0027t submit any patch set; it must be the current one.\n\nCan you clarify what you mean by \"it can lead to untested changes from being submitted\"?",

      "message": "There was an effort by Conley I believe to make it possible to do some of these actions (abandon at least I believe) by just specifying a change, I thought initially that this was why you were updating the docs here, perhaps you are not aware of this change?  With that in mind, I am not sure that your updates calrify the current situation (although I agree with what you are trying to do).\n\nI am also trying to point out that I do not believe that it would be a good idea to be able to submit changes without specifying the PS since it is very important that someone specify exactly which patch set they plan to submit.  I want to prevent the situation where a user decides to submit a change and had been reviewing PS X and then another PS get uploaded quickly, without them realizing it, and approved and they run: \"submit change\" without specifying PSX, and PS Y gets inadvertently submitted (not PS X which they reviewed and intended to submit).",
