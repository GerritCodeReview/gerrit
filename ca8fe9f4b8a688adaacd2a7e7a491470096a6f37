      "message": "It could be, be it doesn\u0027t need to be.  The EVEN_BUS allows you to register to any event \"globally\".  I figured that a menu should care about any events of this type and that there is no need to tie it directly to the Screen class (even though it is indirectly tied to it and I don\u0027t know that we would ever want another class firing them).  If you think it should be changed I will?  If you were just concerned over whether it would work this way, it does. :)",
