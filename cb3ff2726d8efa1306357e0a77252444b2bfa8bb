      "message": "But this is indended, isn\u0027t it. If a NewLabel is configured with MaxWithBlock on a project then no change should be submittable that does not have the highest voting on this label. If nobody has access rights to vote on that label, well then the change cannot be submitted. I can\u0027t see anything wrong with this.\n\nIf you want to change this, then you should rather allow declaring custom labels in project.config on branch level, which would be a cool feature. But this should then rather be done in master.",
