      "message": "So I\u0027m wrong, these were not actually identical. But what is \"init_path\"? It\u0027s not documented above. Was the intent for one of the duplicative references to gerrit.site_path above to actually say init_path? If so, it\u0027s not at all clear to me which one.\n\nHonestly I don\u0027t know what the intended behavior is, and reading the documentation didn\u0027t help me learn. If someone who understands this code wants to take over this change, be my guest.",
