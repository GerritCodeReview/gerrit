      "message": "So I\u0027m wrong, these were not actually identical. But what is \"init_path\"? It\u0027s not documented above. Was the intent for one of the duplicative references to gerrit.site_path above to actually say init_path? If so, it\u0027s not at all clear to me which one.\n\nHonestly I don\u0027t know what the intended behavior is, and reading the documentation didn\u0027t help me learn. If someone who understands this code wants to take over this change, be my guest.",

      "message": "The commit message of [1] contains some more details.\n\nIIUC for auto-site-initialization 2 things were needed: path to site + database connectivity.\n\nIf you already have a Gerrit site that should automatically be updated there are 2 possibilities:\n1. You provide the path to the site by setting the \u0027gerrit.site_path\u0027 system property.\n   Then it can be read from the gerrit.config file how to connect to the database.\n2. You provide how to connect to the database by the \u0027jdbc/ReviewDb\u0027 JNDI property.\n   Then the site path can be read from the system-config table.\n\nIf you don\u0027t have a Gerrit site yet, you must provide both, path to site + database connectivity. In this case the site path is provided by the \u0027gerrit.init_path\u0027 system property and the database connectivity by the \u0027jdbc/ReviewDb\u0027 JNDI property.\nI think the only reason for using \u0027gerrit.init_path\u0027 here instead of \u0027gerrit.site_path\u0027 is that this allows to differentiate this case more easily from case 1. above.\n\nConsidering that ReviewDb is gone now we have 2 cases left:\n1. site exists: you should set the \u0027gerrit.site_path\u0027 system property\n2. site doesn\u0027t exist yet: you should set the \u0027gerrit.init_path\u0027 system property\n\nWe may change that to using \u0027gerrit.site_path\u0027 always but this seems to be unrelated to the ReviewDb removal.\n\nHTH\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/46171",
