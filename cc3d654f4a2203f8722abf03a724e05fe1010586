Our test system there happens to replicate within those time limits, lending a passing scenario execution. Other delays can be set based on one\u0027s own configuration.",

This replication_delay might need to be set to a value *higher* than plugin\u0027s replicationDelay, I agree.\n\nThis change focused on the fact that this default matching applies for precisely (or so) replicating systems. For example, my internal test system for this change: it replicates within seconds once passed the delay. But again, I agree with your concern as this is not likely for every other SUT. -Hence replication_delay that can be set to better suiting values for those.",
