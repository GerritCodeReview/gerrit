Its pending review, but I like D and want to use it to write E. So I download D, create E, and upload it for review.\n\nSo now we have E-\u003eD-\u003eH as the parent chain.\n\nThe old code would only consider E here when I push E. It won\u0027t check D as D is already an existing object.\n\nThe new code will consider both E and D here, and complain that I can\u0027t use your email address as an author/committer in D.",
