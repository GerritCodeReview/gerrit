I did not see in the exports the design for chips in the Change log (when users are added as Reviewers or CC) https://imgur.com/uqxH0SS\n\n3. Non selected chips have a white background color and a border in Grey #dadce0  (which we use for --comment-separator-color: #dadce0 in the app theme).\n\nI\u0027ll follow up shortly with the dark theme specs and will cross reference with the exports.",
