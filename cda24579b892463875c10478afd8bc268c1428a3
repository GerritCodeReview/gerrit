      "message": "Yes, but unified diff is 1% of diff usage compared to 99% side-by-side, so I am not so concerned about it.\n\n`base` and `revision` is just wrong and confusing. I think even in unified diff mode `left` and `right` and clearer to understand, even if not actually correct.\n\nBut I would really appreciate suggestions for better terminology. The only other words that come to my mind are `old` and `new`. I am not quite sure whether I like those better. Replacing `left` and `right` by `old` and `new` across the entire code base would be a huge effort.",
