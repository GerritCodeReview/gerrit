In 3.1 it is precisely the same change https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/refs/heads/stable-3.1/polygerrit-ui/app/elements/change/gr-reply-dialog/gr-reply-dialog.js#415 but it couldn\u0027t be cleanly applied. For master it is the same as for \u00273.2\u0027 hence it is applied by merge in the change that I have provided. Still not sure why would you like to add additional change for it...",
