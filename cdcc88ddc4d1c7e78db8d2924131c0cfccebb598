      "message": "\u003e\"Is it only if the change owner adds a comment? I\u0027m not 100% sure but I seem to remember seeing the same behaviour when non-owners added comments after my review.\"\n\nthis commit only focus on owner\u0027s action, refer below 4 lines 633~636. can be looks as an a bit improvement to Shawn\u0027s idea https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/35880/4..6/gerrit-server/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/server/query/change/ListChanges.java\n\n\nI will test your \"not 100% sure\" concern later :), if it exists, may be it comes from line 640 or other corner, interesting!  anyway I think it belongs to a new topic :  when we talk about one reviewer need to review a change or not, should we take account in other reviewer\u0027s action.  I do not not know the intentional logic about it.  do you  want this commits\u0027s spirit can also apply to this new topic?",
