      "message": "Can you please check the template for gr-list-view and ensure, that there are undefined checks in all functions which appears in binding and have multiple parameters.\nThere is the following binding [[_computeNavLink(offset, -1, itemsPerPage, filter, path)]] in the template - i suppose, that after removing _legacyUndefinedCheck: true it is possible to receive undefined in filter (and probably in other properties). Probably, there are other places in template.\n\nAlso, I suggest to combine together \"Add undefined check ...\" and \"Remove _legacyUndefinedCheck from ...\" changes, because they are logically connected (only for future changes., you can keep existing changes as is).",
