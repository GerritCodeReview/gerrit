File comments should have a comment id, so we can use the COMMENT route for that.\n\nI would just drop this.\n\nIf we want to such a feature, then I would find it extremely weird to have these two patterns:\n\n/c/\u003cproject\u003e/+/\u003cchangeNum\u003e/\u003cpatchNum\u003e/\u003cpath\u003e\n/c/\u003cproject\u003e/+/\u003cchangeNum\u003e/file/\u003cpatchNum\u003e/\u003cpath\u003e\n\nInstead I would rather support \"patchNum\" to understand a special value like \"latest\" (note that \"edit\" is already supported).",

Because it is unclear what exactly user expects to see when link is clicked, Dhruv suggested to add special file link for e-mails and later adjust behavior, if needed. I supported him in this idea\n\n\u003e\u003e Instead I would rather support \"patchNum\" to understand\nAfter reading your comment and refreshing my memory, I started to think that patchNum must be removed from this path.
