File comments should have a comment id, so we can use the COMMENT route for that.\n\nI would just drop this.\n\nIf we want to such a feature, then I would find it extremely weird to have these two patterns:\n\n/c/\u003cproject\u003e/+/\u003cchangeNum\u003e/\u003cpatchNum\u003e/\u003cpath\u003e\n/c/\u003cproject\u003e/+/\u003cchangeNum\u003e/file/\u003cpatchNum\u003e/\u003cpath\u003e\n\nInstead I would rather support \"patchNum\" to understand a special value like \"latest\" (note that \"edit\" is already supported).",

I supported him in this idea\n\n\u003e\u003e Instead I would rather support \"patchNum\" to understand\nAfter reading your comment and refreshing my memory, I started to think that patchNum must be removed from this path.
