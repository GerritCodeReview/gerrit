Then, after this change has been approved by a non-Google maintainer, it will show up in a queue that is processed by our weekly onduty person.\n\nAlso see:\nhttps://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-processes.html#upgrading-libraries\n\nJust to let you know, library upgrades are difficult and time-consuming for us (because we have to upgrade all of Google), so we only do if there is a good reason for it.",
