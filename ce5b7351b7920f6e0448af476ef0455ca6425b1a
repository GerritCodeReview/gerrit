Then, after this change has been approved by a non-Google maintainer, it will show up in a queue that is processed by our weekly onduty person.\n\nAlso see:\nhttps://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-processes.html#upgrading-libraries\n\nJust to let you know, library upgrades are difficult and time-consuming for us (because we have to upgrade all of Google), so we only do if there is a good reason for it.",

      "message": "I missed that Brandon is actually working on upgrading Bouncy Castle for all of Google, which is awesome news. Thanks Brandon! In this case I think it should be OK to submit this, even if Google is not on this version yet. There is only a small risk that we would need to revert the version if the upgrade inside Google fails.\n\nPatrick, WDYT? Can we approve and submit this already now?",
