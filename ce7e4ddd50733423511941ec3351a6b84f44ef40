      "message": "Sweet, thanks for the tip. I\u0027ve redone this using CSS, and can show that it works. However, setting min-height equal to the font size is the wrong thing: a 12pt font usually has a line-height of 14 or 15px, due to ascenders/descenders. In particular, as you can see here, the \"try\" line has a height of 14px, while the empty line has a height of 12px: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/vKzJfLD0HrF (The effect is more pronounced at larger sizes; a 16pt font has a line-height of ~49px.)\n\nThat\u0027s why I was trying to do it in JS, since JS should be able to actually calculate what the current line-height is (e.g. by consulting the height of the line number table cell) and actually set that value, rather than relying on an inaccurate constant.",
