My opinion is that the diff builder just deals with building diffs, whatever context it\u0027s run in.\n\nWould it make sense for the `_preRenderThread` optimization to become a public method on GR-DIFF? That way GR-FILE-LIST could just execute it on the first one and GR-DIFF-VIEW could just run it on its only diff.",
