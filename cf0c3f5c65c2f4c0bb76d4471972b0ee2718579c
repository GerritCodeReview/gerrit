      "message": "BACKGROUND: until this morning, I didn\u0027t know that GWT could link to the base patch using the `a##` syntax. When we needed this behavior in PG, I came up with `b##` where \"b\" means base. Likely, `a` is used in GWT to evoke the `a..b` trope in Git, in the sense that you\u0027re thinking.\n/BACKGROUND\n\nIn light of the existing format, I\u0027d like to remove the `b##` style, but it could potentially kill some links. (Mitigating factor: would only kill links manually selected by users after clicking a line in PG.)\n\nIn general, the right side of the diff is selected by the patch set in the URL, so we\u0027ll never need a `b##` format to select the right side, so we never *need* `b##` to mean the right side. Not a strong motivator for potentially killing links.",
