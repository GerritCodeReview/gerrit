We currently see the following logs ~6 times per week:\n\n\u003e MultiProgressMonitor worker killed after 295056ms: (timeout 56ms, cancelled)\n\nSo this is a change in behavior that might cause issues when being rolled out (today, we tell the client \"timeout\" but the push does process further). Should we gate this behind a flag or increase the default timeout?",
