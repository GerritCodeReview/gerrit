      "message": "FYI this probably doesn\u0027t always work. Booleans are stored as CHAR(1) with value Y for true and N for false. Not every JDBC driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value. It would be safer to use \"Y\".equals(rs.getString()) in code such as this.\n\nCan\u0027t this statement also be written as an UPDATE:\n\n  UPDATE accounts SET reverse_patch_set_order \u003d \u0027Y\u0027\n  WHERE display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order \u003d \u0027Y\u0027;\n\n  UPDATE accounts SET show_username_in_review_category \u003d \u0027Y\u0027\n  WHERE display_person_name_in_review_category \u003d \u0027Y\u0027;\n\nThis should be much faster to process, and every SQL server we support will grok those two small statements. And it avoids the problem with boolean conversion.",
