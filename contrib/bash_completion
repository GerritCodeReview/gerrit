# This bash script adds tab-completion to the gerrit.sh script.
#
# Testing it out without installing
# =================================
#
# To test out the completion without "installing" this, just run this file
# directly, like so:
#
#     . ~/path/to/bash_completion
#
# Note: There's a dot ('.') at the beginning of that command.
#
# After you do that, tab completion will immediately be made available in your
# current Bash shell. It will not, however, be available next time you log in.
#
# Installing
# ==========
#
# To install the completion, copy this file to the appropriate folder for
# your distribution, for example:
#
#     cp ~/path/to/bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d/gerrit_sh
#
# Alternatively you can invoke this file from your .bash_profile, like so:
#
#     . ~/path/to/bash_completion
#
# Do the same in your .bashrc if .bashrc doesn't invoke .bash_profile.
#
# The settings will take effect the next time you log in.
#
# Uninstalling
# ============
#
# To uninstall, just remove the file from the bash completion folder, or
# remove the line from your .bash_profile and .bashrc.
