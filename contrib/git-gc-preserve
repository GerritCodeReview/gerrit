NAME
    git-gc-preserve - Run git gc and preserve old packs to avoid races for JGit

SYNOPSIS
    git gc-preserve

DESCRIPTION
    Runs git gc and can preserve old packs to avoid races with concurrently
    executed commands in JGit.

    This command uses custom git config options to configure if preserved packs
    from the last run of git gc should be pruned and if packs should be preserved.

    This is similar to the implementation in JGit [1] which is used by
    JGit to avoid errors [2] in such situations.

    The command prevents concurrent runs of the command on the same repository
    by acquiring an exclusive file lock on the file "\$repopath/gc-preserve.pid".
    If it cannot acquire the lock it fails immediately with exit code 3.

    Failure Exit Codes
        1: General failure
        2: Couldn't determine repository path. If the current working directory is
           outside of the working tree of the git repository use git option
           --git-dir to pass the root path of the repository.
           E.g.
              $ git --git-dir ~/git/foo gc-preserve 
        3: Another process already runs $0 on the same repository

CONFIGURATION
    "gc.prunepreserved": if set to "true" preserved packs from the last gc run
      are pruned before current packs are preserved.

    "gc.preserveoldpacks": if set to "true" current packs will be hard linked
      to objects/pack/preserved before git gc is executed. JGit will
      fallback to the preserved packs in this directory in case it comes
      across missing objects which might be caused by a concurrent run of
      git gc.
