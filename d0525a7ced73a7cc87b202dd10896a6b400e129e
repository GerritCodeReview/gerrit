I think you can set http_proxy environment variable and our curl command will make use of it for outgoing network connections.\n\nUnfortunately there is no way to downloaded dependencies not automatically over HTTP from the source sites. So you can\u0027t use your corporate Nexus proxy for example. We should at least mention the current limitation of needing to connect to Maven Central and the Gerrit storage bucket.",
