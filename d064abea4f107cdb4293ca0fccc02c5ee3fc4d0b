      "message": "The problem here is that Reviewers not tied to any approvals cannot be removed, since we only compare with existing approvals (not reviewers) before deleting the reviewer.\n\nIf you create a change using the UI, the footer in the notedb looks like this:\n\n    Patch-set: 1\n    Reviewer: Administrator \u003c1000000@gerrit\u003e\n\nHence, Gerrit will throw a ResourceNotFoundException when user tries to remove them. As soon as the reviewer actually sets a score or leaves a comment, the DeleteReviewer functionality will start working again.\n\nNot sure the best way to fix this... Not as straightforward as I initially hoped.",
