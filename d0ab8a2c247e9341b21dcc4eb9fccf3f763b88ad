      "message": "Yes, it is needed because the deletion of several SSH keys is not an atomic operation anymore. AccountApi.deleteSshKeys(...) fires several DELETE requests to the server and if any fails the onFailure method is invoked. It still might be that some DELETE requests succeeded and we don\u0027t know how the table needs to be updated. This is why we are reloading all SSH keys in this case.\n\nI\u0027ve added some JavaDoc to AccountApi.deleteSshKeys(...) so that this behaviour is more obvious.",
