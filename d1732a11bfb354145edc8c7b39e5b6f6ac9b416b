      "message": "A word of caution: libcurl prior to 7.33.0 has a hard limit of 64 characters in password length, after which it silently truncates. This affects a large number of clients in the wild, including for example default curl on OS X 10.9 and earlier.\n\nSo this is fine for now, but can\u0027t grow all that much further. I wouldn\u0027t count on clients upgrading to recent libcurl in a timely fashion.\n\n(By a fun coincidence we just ran into this issue yesterday when our password generator for googlesource.com started spitting out some longer passwords. Yay.)",
