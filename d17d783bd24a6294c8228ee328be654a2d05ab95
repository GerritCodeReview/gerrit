      "message": "If you use the new ChangeDetailCache.GerritCallback() you will only need to override the onFailure method.\n\nIt might even be worth adding a ChangeDetailCache.GerritWidgetCallback() which takes a widget in its constructor which it re-enables in its onFailure() (and likely also in its onSuccess() even though your case seems to be able to get away without it since the UI component is rebuilt I think).  I suspect such a cool Callback, would likely be useful many places!",

Should we consider making approval behavior for various actions more configurable in the future, or is this just asking for too much complexity and would we better off trying to just get things \"right\"?\n\nOne thing for sure is, while it may be good to keep only the vetos, it is not the \"right\" solution since the popularity of our script implies that many people don\u0027t like that policy already.",

I think, if it would be done any differently from when rebasing manually, it could probably confuse the users.\n\nOn a pure personal level, I kinda like that only the Vetos are carried over. Just in this change, an extra patchset was needed after a rebase, due to some non-related refactoring took away a class variable from ChangeUtil. This is easily found if you quickly review the code.
