      "message": "I think you should compute this list on the fly, rather than at constructor time. Initially a site will have no accounts created. After the user creates their first account, they should be able to come back to /become and click on it without restarting the server.\n\nGiven that this is for development purposes only, scanning the first 5 account records on every load of /become is not a performance concern.\n\nI think this implies you need to move the entire processing of the Document object into the doPost() method. But again, this shouldn\u0027t be that much of a problem for development time usage, the HTML document is small and doesn\u0027t take long to parse. Actually, you could defer parsing entirely if the account_id or user_name was present in the request parameters, which would make bookmarks in the browser faster (since we don\u0027t even need to parse the HTML at all during server startup).",

      "message": "Done.\nHowever, bookmarks like http://../become?account_id\u003d1000000\nwork only every second time. Means, if we keep clicking a bookmark like this then:\n- we become this account if we are signed out when clicking the\nbookmark\n- we get signed out if we are signed in when clicking the bookmark\n\nHowever, this issue is not caused by this change... I tried it also\nwithout this change and the issue is present.\nTherefore, I would try to find the cause of it and fix it in a follow up change.",
