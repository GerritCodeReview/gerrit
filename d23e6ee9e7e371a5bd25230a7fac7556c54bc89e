      "message": "This is for all builds, not just the release build, right?\n\nI actually like the idea of having it for non-release builds as well. Having to spend 15 minutes recompiling a dev server on my laptop just because CM/jscompiler/buck was updated is no fun.\n\nThe only question I have is will we ever miss not having non-minified JS for ease of stepping through in a debugger. You would know better than I.",
