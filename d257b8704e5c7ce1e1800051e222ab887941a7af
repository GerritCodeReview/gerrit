After the previous step (running the idea through the mailing list) we could give the contributor a leap of faith and just create the repo if they provide a timeline on when they intend to be done.\n\nThe repo description can list this as \u0027under development\u0027 or \u0027prototype\u0027 or something else.\n\nIf it doesn\u0027t work out, the repo gets deleted.",
