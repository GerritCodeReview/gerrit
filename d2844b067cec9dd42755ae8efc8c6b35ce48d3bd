      "message": "Motivation for this change was first mentioned on the original issue: [1]. Edwin commented on it, that this feature request would be probably accepted.\n\nMoreover some \"interested\" parties from the Gerrit community (OSS and publicly available sites), pointed out their deep concerns to allow to every registered user to upload new changes/patch sets directly in browser. Without even checking out the whole repository, and at least compiling and running the tests (or at least claiming to do so). This change addresses their concern and prevent the projects to be locked in with Gerrit 2.10.x as they claim, they cannot upgrade to any new Gerrit version where the inline edit feature is unconditionally available.\n\nAnother approach (less intrusive as what this change is doing), would be to introduce new global capability \"InlineEdit\". With this approach we could let the UI unchanged and only check in REST handlers that the user has the required capability. This way a site could create new group say \"technical writers\" and allow only members of this group change the documentation using inline edit feature, while still the main developers group would have to do change the code in their local environment.\n\n* [1] https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d2338",
