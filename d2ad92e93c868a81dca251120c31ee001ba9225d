      "message": "Oh, gerrit is one of the projects that does not apply Postel\u0027s law to\nit\u0027s inner components. I still have much to learn about gerrit\u0027s\ncoding style :-(\n\nThanks for review. I moved the \u0027/\u0027 stripping to UrlModule in Patch Set 2.\n\nHowever, I did not add it in Dispatcher.change, as that part is not in\nthe code path from http://host/path/to/gerrit/4711/ to showing the\nchange. It seems that all code paths leading to Dispatcher.change are\nonly used internally. If that is not correct, please let me know and\nI\u0027ll happily add \u0027/\u0027-stripping there as well.",
