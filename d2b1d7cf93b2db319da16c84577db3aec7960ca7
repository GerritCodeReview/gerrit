      "message": "Normally you are right, but in this specific case, where we are messing around with foreign package patches it was failing to create the instance of that class [1] (because JGit jar is signed now). Because of that we had broken master for a couple of days. It was the reason i created that test. As example, try to comment out \"unsign \u003d True\" parameter in maven_jar in lib/jgit/BUCK to see that  this test is going to fail.\n\n\n[1] http://pastebin.com/cZsyGAA0",
