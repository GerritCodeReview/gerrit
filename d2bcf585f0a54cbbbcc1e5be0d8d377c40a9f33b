This function was previously called within changedProperties.has(\u0027serverConfig\u0027) which seemed to haven\u0027t had this.account available.\n\nSo whilst this also simplifies the code it also fixes the bug as well.\n\nAlso setting hasUsernameChange to false after saving was missed (this change adds that)\n\nI think that this.account was returning false was because populating this.account was done after serverConfig was populated.",
