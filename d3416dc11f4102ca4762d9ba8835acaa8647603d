In the end, we need a single base change per project/branch that we base the revert chain on.\n\nWe can fix this in a separate change, but IMO it\u0027s a necessary optimization.",

      "message": "Actually, it is called only once per project/branch: there is an if condition that guards it; cherryPickInput.base is only null in the first change we revert. Afterwards, it will always be determined based on the previous reverts.\n\nI could take that out of the loop for better code clarity, but I have a feeling it will be even more confusing (because of the iterator, etc).
