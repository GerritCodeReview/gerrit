      "message": "Yes, I was thinking that it\u0027s enough to see the rendered HTML in unified/sidebyside diff view. If the rendered HTML is directly shown opening the preview in a new tab is not needed anymore. But looking at how this series is evolving with the latest change [1] I\u0027m now thinking it might make sense to keep this preview option. With [1] I\u0027m starting the highlight added/deleted/changed HTML elements directly in the HTML that is rendered in the diff view. Having a plain HTML preview in addition without any highlight might actually be good.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/54038",
