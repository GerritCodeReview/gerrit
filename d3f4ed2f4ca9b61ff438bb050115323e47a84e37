And, if I click on that tilde-marked related change, I get the latter\u0027s latest patch set (rather than the not-current one). Still, the hereby new highlighting works as expected and doc looks ok \u003d\u003e Verify +1. Not ready to vote CR+1 though, because of this comment about the tilde which could lead to amending this commit message -or so. Or I could be making a mistake within my test case.
