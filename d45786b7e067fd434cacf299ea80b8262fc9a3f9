Should now reindex program be executed during upgrading on the slaves as well? Right now only init command is executed on the slaves. If this is the case, should this be documented in some place?",

      "message": "The group index including all current fields certainly has to be created on slaves (but the content of the index doesn\u0027t need to be up-to-date). I\u0027m not familiar enough with the upgrade procedures for slaves. Up-to-now, did the init step for slaves create all indices but they were simply not used?\n\nFor the regular upgrade, I mentioned in I5143cd0d0 that we need a reindex for the group index. Should I mention in the same paragraph that this step is also mandatory for slave hosts? Or do we typically document slave upgrade procedures somewhere else?",
