It looked initially like a bug for me, then I understood how it works, but maybe it will also confuse someone else.\nSteps:\n1) Click reply, it should show you \"Bring to attention of: \"... and one/more accounts.\n2) Click on the account - the account disappear. To bring it back I have to click Modify.\nBefore this change, click on the account doesn\u0027t change anything, that can be also confusing. \n\nMaybe we can preserve the visibility on step (2) somehow?",

I was initially on your side, but after some discussion we eventually concluded that the confusion is acceptable and that there is no better solution that we could think of. Keeping the selection chip around does not go well with the idea of the summary and the text that goes along with it.",
