      "message": "Since this is essentially twice the same code with different fields, I tried\nto put it in a function. But when I return \u0027\u003cspan class\u003d\"placeholder\"\u003e--\u003c/span\u003e\u0027\nit gets escaped automatically, and ends up literally on screen in the version\ncolumns. Is there a way to return HTML text? Or would one have to create the\nHTML objects in code within the function?\n\nAlthough I discussed with paladox in IRC an I said I\u0027ll try a function, I now\nleft it as is due to the escaping issue above, and because other list handling\nfiles in PolyGerrit seem to also copy/paste this placeholder handling for columns.",
