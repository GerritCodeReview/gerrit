If so, thank you ðŸ˜Š\n\nWe don\u0027t typically consider it sufficient to point to a bug for these kinds of details. The commit message should be self-contained enough that it justifies the change without a reference to an external bug. The bug reference is great as additional context and info, but it doesn\u0027t replace the justification in the message.\n\nPlease describe here how it becomes a bottleneck.\n\nI did read through the bug and it sounds like Luca and Patrick both think this approach at a high level makes sense.
