      "message": "This feels similar to the --preview switch in the task plugin that lets you test how tasks would be evaluated with a different task configuration that\u0027s already been uploaded in a change for review: https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/task/+/refs/heads/master/src/main/resources/Documentation/task.md#change-query-output\n\nWe use that for both development of new task configurations and CI testing to ensure a proposed config is syntactically valid.\n\nWould it be useful to support a similar thing with submit requirements? It seems like a common model will be to propose a change to refs/meta/config with new/modified submit requirements.",
