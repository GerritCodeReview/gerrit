We do that by:\n1) Loading all comments for previous patchsets from NoteDb.\n2) Filter only comments that were written for that specific file path.\n3) Compute the diff of all patchsets that have comments against the latest patchset.\n\nFor any comment that has a different file name on a previous patchset, we will not be able to know if that file was renamed to the file we are looking for (at the latest patchset) because this comment will be filtered by step #2. We don\u0027t know the mapping of {old, new} file name until we request the diff (with step #3). If we want to support this, we\u0027ll end up looking for all diffs for all comments to detect a probable rename, which is what we are trying to avoid.\n\nI\u0027m happy to explain that in chat/gvc if my comment is still unclear.",
