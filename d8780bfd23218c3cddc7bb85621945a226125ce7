I believe it was set like that since the sql query was expensive for some reason. I was not able to fetch the exact reason. For Index backend the Project predicate must be better than (status: open + closed). ProjectPrefixPredicate\u0027s cardinality is not restored, but added cardinality since it is close to ProjectPredicate.",
