I added comments on how to make it work the current way but if this is getting too complicated, IMO feel free to revert to the previous idea.\n\nI think with this idea we didn\u0027t anticipate the problems with draft comments (are there comments + getting posted, or not?) so that is making this approach more complicated.",
