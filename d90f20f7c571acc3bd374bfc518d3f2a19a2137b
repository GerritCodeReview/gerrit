If we want them in a shared file, I recommend just a vanilla JS file that declares a static object (similar to gr-annotation.js).\n\n\u003e In that case, let\u0027s talk about how I should refactor these constants out into a single file. \n\nI also feel that this doesn\u0027t need to hold up this change. Yes, it\u0027s something we need to develop a policy on, but having identically named constants to store the number 500 is not a big deal.",
