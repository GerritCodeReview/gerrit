      "message": "How does this work with canary configs?\n\nWe were planning to turn attention set on for all canary hosts in a week or so. That will work fine for the frontend, but does that also work for the backend? If `cfg` is the canary config for x% of backend traffic, then this approach does not really work. I think we have to either make sure that `cfg` is always prod or use a completely different approach. WDYT?",
