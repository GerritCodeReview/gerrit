      "message": "Yes, you are right, this is a change I plan to upload later today. I originally had hoped to upload this sooner.\n\nThere is a discrepancy between the name of the capability and the command that it gives access to, but only for the show-[caches,connections,queue] commands versus the view[Caches,Connections,Queue] capabilities. I\u0027ll go with the current name for now, I\u0027ll fix this.\n\nIn the long run I will probably suggest to rename either commands or capabilities to align with each other to simplify associations between the two.",

      "message": "Ok, glad you agree with me. One the one hand I see that the command and capability are somewhat different (viewing is allowed, and when you want to see the caches you ask gerrit to show them to you), but on the other hand I think consistency is worth a bit more in this case.\n\nI\u0027ve already located the change 23841 [1] as the one introducing the capabilities.\nI\u0027ll see if there\u0027s time to get around to look into a patch for that too unless someone else is quicker. :-)\n\nThe big problem regards how to migrate the current project.config values from viewCaches to a new showCaches value. But perhaps there\u0027s help out there for this!\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/23841/",
