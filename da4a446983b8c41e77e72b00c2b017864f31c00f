So the change\u0027s change ID does not match the one shown in the commit message.\n\nThe \"This patchset was cherry picked to change\" review comment on the source change mentions the new change ID.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if this the correct behaviour, but it\u0027s the same as \"git cherry-pick -x\" from the command line, which also adds the \"(cherry picked from commit ...)\" line as the last line of the message.",

I create a new change-id in ChangeUtil, so this is expected (and by design), but it has nothing to do with the footers.\n\nI do not change the change-id in the commit message - since that is not expected (git would never do it). I personally do not want the new change to have the same change-id (internally) as the old change. Is that something you really want?",
