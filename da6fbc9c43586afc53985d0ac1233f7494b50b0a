      "message": "This is a valid point and is a subject of discussion. David just abandoned the change that adapted the formatting on stable-2.14 branch, because the cufrent assumption is only master should be adapted. See the related discussion here: [1].\n\nAlso note, that the current CI changes also perform the validation with different versions of gjf depending on the branch: [2].\n\nOf course, we could change the plan, and switch to using gjf 1.5 on all branches. (Given that we have still a lot developing activity even on very stable-2.14 branch, I\u0027m not ruling out this option and I agree that this would simplify cherry-picking and merging.)\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/gerrit/+/125050/4/tools/setup_gjf.sh@21\n\n+ [2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/gerrit-ci-scripts/+/135130/15/jenkins/gerrit-verifier.yaml@163",
