      "message": "I\u0027m a little bit leery of sets of GroupReferences, since GroupReference has the (IMHO) unexpected equals() behavior of comparing only the UUID.\n\nIf everything is working correctly, then this should be fine because the name \u003c-\u003e UUID mapping will be 1-to-1. But if we have a corrupt notes branch where there are multiple names for a single UUID, then this method will have the perhaps unexpected behavior of silently dropping one of the (name, UUID) pairs.\n\nI\u0027m honestly not sure what the best behavior of this method would be in that case, though. Some options (not necessarily exhaustive):\n\n* Include only one (name, UUID) pair for that UUID (the current behavior)\n* Return a list with possible duplicate UUIDs\n* Fail fast\n\n(It would be nice--maybe--if GroupReference included the group name in its equality check, but I strongly suspect that would break things in the permission editing.)",

      "message": "I think we do not want to fail fast. By the end of this series, this method will be called from GroupIncludeCache.AllExternalLoader, and that cache is used by IncludingGroupMembership#getKnownGroups, which is used to create change ETags. So failing to populate that cache will make the whole server essentially unusable until the corruption is fixed.\n\nHaving thought about it a bit more, I think my preferred fix would be to keep the current behavior but add a warning log if you detect duplicates.",
