      "message": "I am not sure whether at this API level it is helpful to have this abstraction. Maybe consider changing this to a `show_sign_col` rendering preference. That would potentially allow users to opt in or out of this independently of `high_contrast`. Or do you envision a bunch of other changes to gr-diff because of `high_contrast`?",
