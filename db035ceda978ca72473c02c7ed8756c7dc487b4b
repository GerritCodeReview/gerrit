      "message": "After seeing this live on gerrit-review, I think this is noisy. Every change seems to have 10+ conflicting changes, which I think is just an artifact of there being lots of old, unlikely-to-merge but still open changes in the project.\n\nI would prefer something like including \"-age:30d\" and/or \"limit:5\" with a link to the full search without that restriction.",

      "message": "Yes, I do agree, it\u0027s just showing too many uninteresting changes. Adding a date filter sounds like a good idea. I\u0027ve just uploaded a change for this [1]. Let\u0027s see how this goes. If needed we can still add a limit to the query.\n\nHaving a link to expand the query is a good idea too. I\u0027ll look into this when I find some free time.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/51972",

      "message": "If I now look at this, the query is actually not exactly returning what I intended.\n\nWhat I wanted is to show all open changes which cannot be merged anymore if the current change is merged, but which have no merge conflict at the moment.\n\nThis second condition is not covered yet. I guess I can fix this if we have the mergeability flag always updated.\n\nThe intention is really that before merging a change you can see if it conflicts with another change that is maybe more important and should be merged first. So that the less important change needs to do the rebase.",
