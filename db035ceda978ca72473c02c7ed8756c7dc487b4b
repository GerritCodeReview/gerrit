Every change seems to have 10+ conflicting changes, which I think is just an artifact of there being lots of old, unlikely-to-merge but still open changes in the project.\n\nI would prefer something like including \"-age:30d\" and/or \"limit:5\" with a link to the full search without that restriction.",
