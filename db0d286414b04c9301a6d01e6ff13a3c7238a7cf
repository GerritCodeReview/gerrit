      "message": "I skipped this one, because the next change in the series directly further bumps the version to 5.1.0. I don\u0027t think we need to mention this intermediate step. It was just done in two changes, because both cherry-picks were required to bring in all connected code changes.\nI don\u0027t know how it affects frontend plugins. I would say it shouldn\u0027t affect them, but that would be more of a question to the UI developers. I found no special mention of the version bumps in the release notes of other Gerrit versions. So I would guess that a special mention would not be required.",
