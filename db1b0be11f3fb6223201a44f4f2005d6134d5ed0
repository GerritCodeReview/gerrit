      "message": "This patchset \"works\", as in, it is possible to extract ChangeNotes even when they are coming from a different server to the one where the extraction is happening.\n\nHowever, returning a negative account when not present is a bit hacky :P\n\nProbably the proper solution would be to transform Account in an interface. One of the implementations could be VisitorAccount (or something with a better name), which will be returned from parseIdent in case the Change is coming from a different server. This will involve quite a big refactoring I believe.\n\n@luca, @dave, @david: Any better idea on how we could tackle this?",
