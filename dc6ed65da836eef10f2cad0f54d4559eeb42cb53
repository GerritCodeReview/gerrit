This would likely cover most of the commits. \n\nThe current tip version creates a bitset for each commit. This change modifies that approach to only create and keep a bitset for commits directly pointed to by tags. Non-tag commits have their BitSet (if any) copied/ORed with their parent(s).\n\n\u003e \n\u003e So, where does the space savings come from? Is it because of incremental updates to the tagset (that somehow avoid creating bitsets?)\n\nNo, we didn\u0027t modify the incremental update behavior.\n\nIf you have many commits that aren\u0027t directly referenced by a tag and also have many non-tag/non-change refs, then the tip implementation will comparatively use a lot of memory because you have big BitSets (many non-tag/non-change refs) and many of them (many commits walked and each commit has a unique BitSet). Those \"intermediate\" commits are never referenced outside the walk, and having a BitSet on them was just a convenience so that you could always OR with your parents.",
