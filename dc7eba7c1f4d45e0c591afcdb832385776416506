      "message": "I thought of this but I can imagine people having workflows where they partially Save their changes and want to continue editing without leaving the editor view.\nWe do save edits-in-progress in local storage so probably constantly saving their edits is not required for any user.\n\nI would be fine with removing the Save button. \n\nNote: The follow up change is also adding a Publish button so reducing space would be even more valuable.\n@Ben WDYT?",
