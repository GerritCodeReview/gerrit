But since groupids aren\u0027t used yet, I think you should be fine without this hack (you might wanna check with Shawn).",

      "message": "Right, EGit uses \u0027I00...\u0027 as placeholder for the Change-Id in the commit message. Once there was a bug that the placeholder was not properly replaced on commit so that it stayed unchanged in the commit message. Also there were some users which copied this placeholder as Change-Id into the commit message when working with git command line (because they were thinking that\u0027s the way to generate a Change-Id). As result there were quite a lot of changes with \u0027I00...\u0027 as Change-Id and Shawn added this check to reject these changes.\n\nSo I agree with Martin that for the Group-Id this check should not be needed.",
