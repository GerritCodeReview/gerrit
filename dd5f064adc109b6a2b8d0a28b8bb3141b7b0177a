      "message": "can you be more accurate on `multiple elements` here ? this message is hard to connect to why you made the change.\n\nif i understand correctly, you don\u0027t want to have the logic in cursor-manager as its used *not only* in diff, but also in file lis t dropdown etc.\n\nIf so, why not have it in `gr-diff-cursor` ? why it needs to be in gr-diff-view ? I assume `navigate to next file` is just an variant when you moveToNextChunk in diff cursor",
