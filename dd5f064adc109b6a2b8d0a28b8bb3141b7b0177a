      "message": "can you be more accurate on `multiple elements` here ? this message is hard to connect to why you made the change.\n\nif i understand correctly, you don\u0027t want to have the logic in cursor-manager as its used *not only* in diff, but also in file lis t dropdown etc.\n\nIf so, why not have it in `gr-diff-cursor` ? why it needs to be in gr-diff-view ? I assume `navigate to next file` is just an variant when you moveToNextChunk in diff cursor",

      "message": "The reason is that the cursors should not be concerned about the toasts(whether they were shown 5 seconds ago), and the navigation to next unreviewed file.\nIt makes more sense to let diff-view handle it.\nCursor retains it\u0027s original job to moveToNextChunk.",

      "message": "I am not convinced... I feel its the same behavior, and it feels weird to have it handled in two different places instead of one. I still don\u0027t see why it can not be in the `gr-diff-cursor` (is not it still a cursor behavior, just move to next chunk in next file ?)\n\nregarding the toast, do we really need the toast ? I think it can be pretty annoying soon after I know that behavior and if it still keep showing and asking me to press to navigate again, not mention the a11y. Compared to use the toast, maybe just mention that in the shortcut dialog that `n` will cross file if reach the end of the diff.\n\nlet\u0027s keep the thread open for more opinions.",
