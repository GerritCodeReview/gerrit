      "message": "can you be more accurate on `multiple elements` here ? this message is hard to connect to why you made the change.\n\nif i understand correctly, you don\u0027t want to have the logic in cursor-manager as its used *not only* in diff, but also in file lis t dropdown etc.\n\nIf so, why not have it in `gr-diff-cursor` ? why it needs to be in gr-diff-view ? I assume `navigate to next file` is just an variant when you moveToNextChunk in diff cursor",

      "message": "I am not convinced... I feel its the same behavior, and it feels weird to have it handled in two different places instead of one. I still don\u0027t see why it can not be in the `gr-diff-cursor` (is not it still a cursor behavior, just move to next chunk in next file ?)\n\nregarding the toast, do we really need the toast ? I think it can be pretty annoying soon after I know that behavior and if it still keep showing and asking me to press to navigate again, not mention the a11y. Compared to use the toast, maybe just mention that in the shortcut dialog that `n` will cross file if reach the end of the diff.\n\nlet\u0027s keep the thread open for more opinions.",

That is a problem for every single toast(seeing it again and again).\nThis is how Critique handles it btw.\n\nAlso why should the cursor manage showing the toasts etc?

      "message": "ya what other tools are doing doesn\u0027t make it right. Personally I never liked toasts for tips (usually tips are in new user tutorial and only show once), I like them when they are there to show me status changes, errors etc.\n\nI guess for me, `cursor` is in charge of the moving your view and current focus with keyboard, so that `moving` seems include the `next chunk`, `next line`, `next comment`, and `next file`. Especially we reuse the same concept in the change page with all diff expanded, `n` is navigating across files there already, and I don\u0027t think we have special handling in gr-diff for it (did not check tho) ?",
