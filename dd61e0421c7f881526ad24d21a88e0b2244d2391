If you really have 25M records in account_patch_reviews you should just do some cleanup *before* even starting the migration process.\n\naccount_patch_reviews is a table that contains a reference to the files that have been reviewed for open changes.\n\nWould it be instead more meaningful to write a simple clean-up script?\nJust remove all rows associated with:\n- abandoned changes\n- merged changes\n\nWDYT?",
