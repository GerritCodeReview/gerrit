      "message": "Is there actually anything different about the 4.10.2 index version? The bugfixes I read about looked like they were entirely in client code and wouldn\u0027t affect the storage format. If we don\u0027t have to change the storage format on bugfix releases this would save some churn.\n\n(Actually one thing low on my list of cleanups is to rework Lucene schema version numbering so we keep track of the Lucene sub-version separately and don\u0027t have to bump the global schema version even when there is an on-disk format change. We already do this for googlesoruce.com and it works out well.)",
