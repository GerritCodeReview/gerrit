With regards to GerritHub.io, unfortunately we are still stuck in Gerrit v3.6.x because of a regression in v3.7.0 on stream events that blocks re-runs of builds from Jenkins and Zuul [3]. If we upgrade, we would break many people\u0027s CI/CD pipelines.\n\nFor that reason we cannot confirm [1] with 2 weeks of production run on GerritHub.io, but Google could.\n\n\u003e I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve been doing that, but I don\u0027t know when we\u0027ve done a JGit bump like that post describes either.\n\u003e \n\u003e Also, that post seems to be saying the tests would run on master, but should there be tests run with stable-3.5 (too)?\n\nMore tests are always more than welcome üëç\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/355916\n[2] https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2022-01-12-esc-minutes.html#definition-of-a-policy-for-updating-jgit-on-stable-gerrit-branches\n[3] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d16475",
