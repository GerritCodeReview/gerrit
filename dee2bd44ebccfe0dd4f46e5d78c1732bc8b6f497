In any event, this is intrusive change, that I would compare with adding support for Git wire protocol v2. So that my plan would be:\n\n* next release: MINA ssh client option is added, but JSch is still the default\n* next release + 1: MINA ssh client is swapped to be the default, but JSch is still there\n* next release + 2: Support for JSch is dropped (probably also from JGit protocol)",

MINA sshd does have support for this (I think at least for ssh-agent, via the Tomcat APR library; not sure about Pageant). See JGit issues 541274 and 541275.[1][2]\n\nFor JSch, there is (was?) Gunnar Wagenknecht\u0027s third-party bundles[3][4]. IIRC this never made it into core Eclipse because the underlying JSch code accesses JDK internals. (And I don\u0027t know if it even still works on JDK \u003e 8.) See also Eclipse issue report 179924.[5]\n\nUnrelated to all this: Eclipse also would like to drop JSch outside of EGit/JGit; see Eclipse issue report 540727.[6] But that is a huge task; IMO bigger than adding MINA sshd to JGit, and will need a dedicated sponsor. \n\n[1] https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d541274\n[2] https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d541275\n[3] https://eclipseguru.github.io/eclipse-jsch-agent-proxy/\n[4] https://github.com/eclipseguru/eclipse-jsch-agent-proxy\n[5] https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d179924\n[6] https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d540727",

Should we defer the question about doing this to ESC before moving this change and updating JGit to tip of master branch on stable-3.2?",
