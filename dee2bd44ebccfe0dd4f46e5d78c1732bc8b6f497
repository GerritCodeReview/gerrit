      "message": "Define the future? This change is snot merged yet. So, we still don\u0027t know whether or not it is included in 3.2 release. In any event, this is intrusive change, that I would compare with adding support for Git wire protocol v2. So that my plan would be:\n\n* next release: MINA ssh client option is added, but JSch is still the default\n* next release + 1: MINA ssh client is swapped to be the default, but JSch is still there\n* next release + 2: Support for JSch is dropped (probably also from JGit protocol)",

MINA sshd does have support for this (I think at least for ssh-agent, via the Tomcat APR library; not sure about Pageant). See JGit issues 541274 and 541275.[1][2]\n\nFor JSch, there is (was?) Gunnar Wagenknecht\u0027s third-party bundles[3][4]. IIRC this never made it into core Eclipse because the underlying JSch code accesses JDK internals. (And I don\u0027t know if it even still works on JDK \u003e 8.) See also Eclipse issue report 179924.[5]\n\nUnrelated to all this: Eclipse also would like to drop JSch outside of EGit/JGit; see Eclipse issue report 540727.[6] But that is a huge task; IMO bigger than adding MINA sshd to JGit, and will need a dedicated sponsor. \n\n[1] https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d541274\n[2] https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d541275\n[3] https://eclipseguru.github.io/eclipse-jsch-agent-proxy/\n[4] https://github.com/eclipseguru/eclipse-jsch-agent-proxy\n[5] https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d179924\n[6] https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d540727",
