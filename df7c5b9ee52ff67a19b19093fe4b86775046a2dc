      "message": "Thanks a lot for updating. Google is currently using highlightjs 10.6 with gerrit. \n\nThere are 2 blocking issues:\n- highlightjs is deprecating highlightBlock that we are using in Gerrit. Deprecation is quite aggressive, every call to highlightBlock makes console.log about deprecation. I see that you have related change of changing this API. We need to make sure that highlightLine works with highlightjs 10.6 or we should support both highlightBlock and highlightLine.\n\n- there is a regression in highlighting https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/3093\nI am planning to reopen and discuss with them that bug. I would give some time for bug reporting/user feedback to highlightjs. ",

Unless you meant highlightjs?\n\nWell that function supports both the new object type and the old deprecated type so upgrading shouldn\u0027t be an issue.\n\nThe only thing is the new type doesn\u0027t support continuation so we need to add support for that.
