      "message": "Thanks a lot for updating. Google is currently using highlightjs 10.6 with gerrit. \n\nThere are 2 blocking issues:\n- highlightjs is deprecating highlightBlock that we are using in Gerrit. Deprecation is quite aggressive, every call to highlightBlock makes console.log about deprecation. I see that you have related change of changing this API. We need to make sure that highlightLine works with highlightjs 10.6 or we should support both highlightBlock and highlightLine.\n\n- there is a regression in highlighting https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/3093\nI am planning to reopen and discuss with them that bug. I would give some time for bug reporting/user feedback to highlightjs. ",
