      "message": "This doesn\u0027t make sense to me (both as an idea and the grammar). I think it\u0027s saying that if Lucene changed their max term length and we used this constant, it would affect us. But if Lucene changed, wouldn\u0027t we also want to change ours?\n\nAdditionally, this should probably come from a config (that each index backend can provide a default for) since it\u0027s probably an index backend specific value?",

      "message": "Sorry for the bad grammar. Should have checked the comment more closely myself.\n\nI saw David\u0027s comment here: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/328636. He just states that we should not rely on the value provided by Lucene without giving a reason. My own reasoning was that we would like to have closer control on the indexed data ourselves. Maybe @david.ostrovsky@gmail.com could comment on why we should redefine the constant?\n\nMaking it configurable would be nice. I guess however that this would require major changes, since all values in the field are constants. The only reasonable way of doing that would be Guice providing multiple versions of the ChangeField class dependent on the configured index type. Not sure whether we should do that in a stable branch, especially since Lucene is currently the only officially supported index, that Elasticsearch is also based on Lucene and thus likely has the same limitation and that this truncation would only be a small inconvenience for people using an index supporting larger value sizes.",
