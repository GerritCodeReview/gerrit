      "message": "These two parameters are not needed when evaluating prolog rules from refs/meta/config:rules.pl which is the normal case.\nFor the normal case we never skip submit filters and this class knows how to create an InputStream from the refs/meta/config:rules.pl. A caller would have to pass NULL as the InputStream in this. This is also not nice.\nOr, are you suggesting to have two evaluate methods? One without parameters and one with these 2 parameters?\n\nOnly when we want to test user provided submit rules (from stdin) we would use these two parameters.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know what the common use case is, but I am imagining 3 possibilities:  1) the evaluator object is instantiated, used once discarded (or several times, but all with the same settings) 2) the evaluator object is instantiated, used a bunch of times with one setting for these values, then tweaked, then used a bunch more with the new settings, repeat or discard 3) the evaluator object is instantiated and on each call these settings are likely to be different.   If #1 is the use case, these parameters should have been passed into the constructor.  If #2 is the general use case, what you have is good.  However if #3 is the use case, then you should pas these parameters into the evaluate function.  I was assuming that #3 would be the case, but I may have been way off.  Which use case pattern do you anticipate?",
