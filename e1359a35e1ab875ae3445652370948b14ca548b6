      "message": "The reason for the breakage is the collision with bower_component, that is also called bower-component. I tried to rename it to codemirror-minified-component, but it failed with: [1]. Should we rename codemirror-minified used for GWT with codemirror-minified-gwt and codemirror-original-gwt instead? The big advantage of that approach: we would disambiguate and avoid potential collisions for two external repositories:\n\n* codemirror_minified used for GWT\n* codemirror-minified bower component used for codemirror-editor plugin\n\nthat currently only differs with hyphen. This diff fixed it: [2].\n\n* [1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/723365\n* [2] http://paste.openstack.org/show/723366",
