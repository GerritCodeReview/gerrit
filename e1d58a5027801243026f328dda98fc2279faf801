The current DocIndexer will then find the proper title.\n\nMy change makes the DocIndexer to skip the :linkattrs: which will work in all situations:\n\n- AsciiDoctor 1.5.2 for Google Source since my change skips :linkattrs: when looking for the title.  Then https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/ documentation search points to Google.com search engine and are thus unaffected by documents having the wrong title, they still need link attributes to be enabled for rendering.\n\n- AsciiDoctor 1.5.7 which we use now but the document still have :linkattrs: for Google source. My change skip the :linkattrs: and will make document indexer with the proper title.\n\n- AsciiDoctor 1.5.7 without :linkattrs: which can only be done after Google Source has upgraded.\n\nI don\u0027t think we need to rollback to 1.5.2 unless we want to be aligned with Google Source (which might be a good thing).\n\nIn any case this change will at least fix the document title and should land whether we use 1.5.2 or 1.5.7 :)",
