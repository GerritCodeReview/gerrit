      "message": "I took a closer look:\n\nhttps://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/71381 added this band-aid because we were falling back in Gerrit to a different diff algorithm and retriggered the computation.\n\nThis logic is no longer there. The fallback is a `negative` result. DiffOperationsImpl l.307 uses that as an indicator to perform a histogram diff without Myers fallback.\n\nThe diff entry was process directly by another thread here before, so it was synchronized. I think we can safely remove that since this reusing isn\u0027t happening anymore.\n\nYoussef, can you please double-check my thinking?",
