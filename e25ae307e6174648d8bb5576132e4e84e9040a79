Something like:\n\n```\nThis change returns HTTP status code 400 BAD_REQUEST in the following scenarios:\n- When a large/medium group is included as a Reviewer.\n- When an email without an associated account is included as a CC.\n- When an email without an associated account is included as a Reviewer.\n\nPreviously, the logic would return an HTTP status code 200 OK.\n```",
