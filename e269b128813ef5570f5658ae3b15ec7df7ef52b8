      "message": "That\u0027s unexpected that you are using POST action instead of GET here. And (ab)-use request body to tell in POST that you want GET by passing operation \u003d LIST.\n\nAnother consequence of doing this, is that you would probably need to manually mess around with two capabilities (and cannot use Annotations), because there are two different capabilities for Viewing and Flushing caches.\n\nAs you pointed out above, SSH command already specifies --list option. So why not to add similar option to GET request and only list the caches when this option is passed instead of returning a map of cache infos:\n\n  GET /config/server/caches?list",
