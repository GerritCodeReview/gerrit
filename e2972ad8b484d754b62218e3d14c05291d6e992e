      "message": "This is standard tools/workspace_status.py for plugins that support standalone build mode e.g.: [1]. But it\u0027s pointless to call this scripts, because it will do the same as vanilla gerrit own workspace_status.py would do: just call git describe: `v \u003d revision(p, ROOT)`.\n\nTo avoid that we could choose the same naming convention: contrib/workspace_status_release.py would call workspace_status_release.py om plugin directory. That way we wouldn\u0027t mix it. WDYT? It could be in tools directiory of the plugin. Theretically, plugin could have both: standard workspace_status.py and more smart workspace_status_release.py command.\n\n[1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/reviewers/+/refs/heads/stable-3.0/tools/workspace_status.py",
