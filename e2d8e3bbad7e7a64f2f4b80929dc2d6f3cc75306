However, we should document in JavaDoc what the class is representing.\n\nWhat about saying something like:\n\nFilter out inactive accounts for preventing old sessions to be reused\nfor authenticating incoming HTTP calls as come from an IdentifiedUser.\n\nOr anything different that identify what the filter is actually doing?",

      "message": "I would not do the logout redirection, as Gerrit can figure things on its own.\n\nIf we do not manage redirection, a user that is reading the Documentation while his/her account gets deactivated can continue to read the Documentation anymously. Same for a user that is looking at public Changes while his/her account gets deactivated can continue to navigate around. But a user that is attempting to do a privileged operation is denied and gets prompted to login again.\n\nIf we manage redirection, each of the above cases take the user to the logoutUrl. It would be counter-intuitive to take someone that is looking at public changes or documentation to the logoutUrl.\n\n\u003e We could also introduce a different logout experience, as the user should be informed why\n\u003e he has been logged out forcibly.\n\nFor that we\u0027d first need to ask for a reason from the admin that deactivated the account. While I like that idea, this would be\na bigger change. So I would kick that down the road a bit and first solve the issue at hand and leave \"collecting a reason for the deactivation\" and \"showing the deactivation reason for HTTP and SSH logouts\" for future commits.",
