      "message": "What is the reason for this change?  Is there some specific workflow that you are trying to fix/enable?\n\nAs far as a branch maintainer is concerned, moving a change to another branch is very close to abandoning it, just as it is close to creating a new patchset/change on another branch.  We have many branches, and when some branch approaches EOL, then often upload permissions are restricted to that branch.  Once upload is restricted, abandoning a change can be problematic since you likely can no longer unabandon it.  I don\u0027t know who specifically added the abandon change permission, and what workflow they were looking to restrict by adding that permission.  Was it to prevent the workflow problem that I mention above?  Either way, I suspect that we don\u0027t want to interfere with that workflow with moves either, and removing the abandon check on move will.",
