      "message": "Something is not clear here to me. group1.done() is removed, but addFinal is only added in on non edit case. What about  edit case? Also it would be great i we could optimize loading of base file content: If base version was deactivated we would still load the base content. This is wasteful. This would make the code more complex, as we would need to conditionally load the content (if we hadn\u0027t loaded it yet) if the merge view is toggled from diff screen per checkbox (instantly) or per edit prefererences.",
