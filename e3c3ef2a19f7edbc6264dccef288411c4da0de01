      "message": "Upgrading from 1.3 to 1.4 would require that the users would need some manual migration steps, because automatic migration isn\u0027t supported yet (see roadmap): [1], [2]. And H2 is used in the wild as production database even though it\u0027s not recommended. So I wonder if we really need these troubles, and not jut stay on 1.3 release line until ReviewDb is killed?\n\nQuoting the roadmap for 1.4:\n\n   Version 1.4.x: Planned Changes\n      Change license to MPL 2.0.\n      Automatic migration from 1.3 databases to 1.4. \n\n* [1] http://www.h2database.com/html/roadmap.html\n* [2] http://h2database.com/html/tutorial.html#upgrade_backup_restore",
