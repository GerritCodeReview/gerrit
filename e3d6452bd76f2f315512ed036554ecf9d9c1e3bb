This works as a workaround for the formatList2 case because it ensures cd.patches(db) is called before cd.currentPatchSet(db). But the intent of the API and the too-smart-for-its-own-good caching was that you  should be able to call cd.patches(db) and cd.currentPatchSet(db) in any order and it should just work.",
