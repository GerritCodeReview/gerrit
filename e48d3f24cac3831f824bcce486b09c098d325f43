How can I or any other see that change again? Only me? Can I restore abandoned changes that was abandoned in self-review phase, before review was \"started\"? Can i continue to work on this change, e.g. upload further patch sets and \"start review process\"?",

      "message": "It\u0027s less about whether a change or patch set is visible, and more about notifications and dashboards.\n\nI don\u0027t intend to have any impact on the abandon-restore workflow. Let\u0027s say a change never has a reviewable patch set before it gets abandoned. That notification will still go out to a few of the existing watch types (unless notify\u003dNONE is passed in with the abandon call, of course). The difference is that we\u0027ll have a new watch type that won\u0027t ever see a change like this. An abandoned not-yet-reviewable change could still be restored, as usual, and could become reviewable when a pre-abandon or post-restore patch set is marked as reviewable, thus kicking off the normal review workflow.",

      "message": "To clarify, a not-yet-reviewable change can appear in searches, but I prefer that it doesn\u0027t show up in anyone\u0027s dashboard. I prefer that not-yet-reviewable patch sets be hidden in the UI (or at least deemphasized).\n\nMy rationale is that it\u0027s a good thing when reviewers are quick to review a patch set as soon as they see it. Sometimes reviewers jump the gun. To avoid this, they have to consider the context. Do I wait for CI? Tests failed, should I wait for a revision? By thoughtfully hiding these patch sets until the author says they\u0027re ready, we can eliminate the need for the reviewer to make a judgment call. The goal is: when you, as a reviewer, see a patch set, it\u0027s good to review.\n\nHard privacy is not a requirement. That is, if you guess that change X has not-yet-reviewable PS Y, nothing prevents you from fetching the corresponding ref and viewing it. I wouldn\u0027t object to offering that view in the UI, either. I just want to hide it such patch sets by default on projects or changes that are opting into this new workflow.",
