      "message": "That\u0027s right. Clicking the INPUT directly works, but what I\u0027m trying to achieve is making the click area larger. Using a LABEL would be the typical way to achieve this, but in this case, I want the click area to correspond to the TD table cell element (which also takes on a hover style).\n\nIt seems to me that a click handler like this is more lightweight than adding a LABEL in between the TD and the INPUT and applying CSS to make it fill the cell.",
