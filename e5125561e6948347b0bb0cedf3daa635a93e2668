      "message": "I tried that approach initially and ran into several issues, largely due to the fact that this isn\u0027t a real boolean prop that tracks this information. It has three valid states: true, false, and undefined. \n\nThis doesn\u0027t work if I repurpose the _expanded prop in message-list, as there is at least one computed field that is dependent on that prop.\n\nSetting this field on the message object itself gives me the \u0027three state boolean\u0027 that I need here, and also lets the gr-message determine whether or not it should be expanded based on its parameters.",
