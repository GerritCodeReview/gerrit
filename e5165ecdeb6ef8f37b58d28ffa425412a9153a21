See the commit message in change 50890 for explanation:\n\n  For deleting a branch by pushing to Gerrit it is required to have\n  force push permissions. For convenience project owners are allowed to\n  delete branches through WebUI/REST/SSH without force push permission\n  (because they anyway can assign this permission themselves).\n\nIf you want to prevent project owners to remove branches, disallow it on parent project.

      "message": "My opinion is that the reasoning in the commit message is poor.\nWith that reasoning Project Owners should be allowed to do everything regardless of what is configured.\nIt is more likely that you, as a project owner, only want the permissions you have given yourself to avoid doing things, like deleting branches, by mistake.\n\n\u003e If you want to prevent project owners to remove branches, disallow it on parent project. Done.\nThat\u0027s not really a solution, then Project Owners would need to ask the Owners of the parent project if they want to actually delete a branch on purpose!\nThis is not a change to uphold some company policy, this was brought to our attention by actual project owners who deleted a branch by accident from the UI.\nProject Owners should be able to configure their own permissions, why should Gerrit be opinionated about who should be able to delete branches? This goes against every other rule in the ACL (except for maybe admin permissions but that\u0027s a different story IMO).\n\nIf Project Owners want to prevent themselves from deleting branches by mistake, why shouldn\u0027t Gerrit let them?",

I agree that the change needs to be documented. \nSince 3.4 is released, it would also mean aiming at a 3.5 release, since we shouldn\u0027t be introducing breaking changes to stable branches.\n\nI am not sure if I agree with your followup argument though.\n\nYes, people can make mistakes, but that\u0027s always been the case.\nThis doesn\u0027t remove that from being a thing, but it does potentially help to prevent it from happening.\n\nYes, if people forget to revert their temporary delete permissions, they will be back at square 0, but at least \"our hands are clean\". They explicitly gave themselves the permissions to screw it up, as opposed to the current state of \"I can screw it up without even being aware I can screw it up\".\n\nA temporary permission system would be pretty cool to safeguard stuff like this. (e.g. Edit Access rules via UI, new Button \"temporary\" Gerrit automatically reverts that change 15 minutes later, or opens a change to revert it and assigns project owners to review/the Attention-Set).\nThat would probably have it\u0027s own problems.",
