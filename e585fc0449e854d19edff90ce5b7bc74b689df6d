      "message": "They do seem redundant, but I think it makes the files easier to work with. By declaring the constant we get an error early at BUCK file parse time if a constant is mistyped in a maven_jar() rule, rather than waiting for a time when maven_jar() tries to invoke download_file.py.\n\nI also just find the repository\u003dGERRIT string easier to read than repository\u003d\u0027GERRIT:\u0027. These are logically the same value and could be used interchangeably. I would just prefer to read the constant version.\n\nSo we have them.. because I like them. They aren\u0027t actually required.",
