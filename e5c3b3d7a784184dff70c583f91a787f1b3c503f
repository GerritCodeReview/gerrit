      "message": "Hmm. Unfortunately, \"group Foo \u003cuuid\u003e\" looks a lot like \"A Name \u003cemail\u003e\" where the first name is \"group\".\n\nIn fact, since the UUID may be any UUID from any external group system, if you have a group system whose UUIDs look like \"\u003cgoogle/repo-discuss@googlegroups.com\u003e\", then the only way to distinguish between a member footer and a subgroup footer is by trying to parse the footer as \u003cid@serverId\u003e. We could do that, but that seems a little brittle.\n\nOther options, in decreasing order of preference:\n\n* Don\u0027t put the UUID in angle brackets; go back to parens.\n* Use a different footer.\n* Instead of \"group \", use a prefix that cannot be parsed as a valid name. I think in practice with JGit\u0027s parsing library, this means the prefix would need to contain \u0027\u003c\u0027, which would be ugly.",
