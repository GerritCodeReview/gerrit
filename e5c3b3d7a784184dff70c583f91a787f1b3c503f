      "message": "Hmm. Unfortunately, \"group Foo \u003cuuid\u003e\" looks a lot like \"A Name \u003cemail\u003e\" where the first name is \"group\".\n\nIn fact, since the UUID may be any UUID from any external group system, if you have a group system whose UUIDs look like \"\u003cgoogle/repo-discuss@googlegroups.com\u003e\", then the only way to distinguish between a member footer and a subgroup footer is by trying to parse the footer as \u003cid@serverId\u003e. We could do that, but that seems a little brittle.\n\nOther options, in decreasing order of preference:\n\n* Don\u0027t put the UUID in angle brackets; go back to parens.\n* Use a different footer.\n* Instead of \"group \", use a prefix that cannot be parsed as a valid name. I think in practice with JGit\u0027s parsing library, this means the prefix would need to contain \u0027\u003c\u0027, which would be ugly.",

      "message": "It gets worse. If we use () (or really anything) instead of \u003c\u003e for groups, we still have a problem with this input:\n\n group Something \u003cemail.in@group.name\u003e (uuid)\n\nRawParseUtils.parsePersonIdent ignores everything after the first \u003cemail\u003e, so it will return new PersonIdent(\"group Something\", \"\u003cemail.in@group.name\u003e\", 0, 0).\n\nOf course we can work around this by having Gerrit reject it if there is garbage after \u003cemail\u003e. But at this point I think we should just use a different footer.",
