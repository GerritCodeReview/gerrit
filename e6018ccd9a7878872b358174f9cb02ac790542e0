      "message": "This is a nice way to do this. I just have a couple suggestions:\n\nAt the gr-cursor-manager level, it isn\u0027t specialized to diffs, so I think the word \"chunk\" isn\u0027t right here. Could change `_targetIsChunk` to `_targetHeight` and use that in the `bottom` calculation of `_scrollToTarget`.\n\nThat might make this into ...\n\nif (opt_condition) {\n  this._targetHeight \u003d newTarget.parentNode.scrollHeight;\n}\n\nFurthermore, it\u0027s the presence of an `opt_condition` doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that the target height is the height of its parent. I\u0027d suggest creating a new optional parameter called something like `opt_getTargetHeight` for this ...\n\nif (opt_getTargetHeight) {\n  this._targetHeight \u003d opt_getTargetHeight(newTarget);\n} else {\n  this._targetHeight \u003d newTarget.scrollHeight;\n}\n\nThen, when moving the cursor between chunks, could pass the following for `opt_getTargetHeight` ...\n\nfunction(target) {\n  return target.parentNode.scrollHeight;\n}\n\nHow does that seem to you? Do you think this is trying to be too flexible?",
