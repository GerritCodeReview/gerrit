Actually we are trying to remove all unneeded things from the ChangeScreen since it is already quite crowded.\n\nI really like the idea of displaying the commit message in a table. We actually discussed about this at the last Gerrit Hackathon. If I remember correctly the idea there was to have a table for the commit message, but to place the commit summary into the table header and the commit summary as first row. Does this make sense to you?",
