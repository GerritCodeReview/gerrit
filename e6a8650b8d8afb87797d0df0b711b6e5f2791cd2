      "message": "@brohlfs@google.com The patchset uses document.addEventListener to listen for \u0027location-change\u0027 event but currently window.dispatchEvent is still used to trigger \u0027location-change\u0027 event in the stable-3.6 branch. \"window\" was replaced with \"document\" in change 75656e7113bfb437c73da9dde51be524c5c367ad but it is not merged into the stable-3.6 branch. We should either merge 75656e7113bfb437c73da9dde51be524c5c367ad into the stable-3.6 branch first or manually change window.dispatchEvent to document.dispatchEvent in this change.",
