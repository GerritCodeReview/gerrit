      "message": "This is not true :-)\n\nThis cache returns a ProjectState, which is an inheritance accessor for CachedProjectConfig. However, it does not actually cache that (so \"it must be carefully evicted\" is not accurate).\n\nIt produces a fresh ProjectState everytime you call it, but that is just a very thin wrapper around a single CachedProjectState and a reference to this cache so that it can serve as accessor for inherited values.\n\nThe cache has to be evicted because it holds onto a CachedProjectState keyed only by Project.NameKey for faster access. The persisted variant is keyed by SHA1 of refs/meta/config which is not an option for the in-mem variante because it would mean that any call to the cache entails opening the repo and reading a SHA1 which for dashboard pages would mean we do this 100-1000 times (resolving acls).",
