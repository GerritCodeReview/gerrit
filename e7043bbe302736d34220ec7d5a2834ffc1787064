I expected it to pop up an edit dialog (i.e. be the same as the edit button).\n\nSimilarly I think for paths which aren\u0027t editable (commit message, deleted files, etc.), clicking on the path simply shouldn\u0027t be an option while in edit mode.",

While i can see how it may be expected that the path also would navigate the users to edit dialog, it may also be expected to still be used for SBS2. I will add a comment to reconsider this part of UI integration/behaviour later on.",
