Perhaps you could make it a lot clearer by having two entirely separate paths for those cases? I know this suggestion deviates from the typical pattern of loading a Map, but it seems like it would eliminate some of the extra conditional complexity?\n\ni.e\n\n if (/* is cached */) {\n\n   return...\n }\n\n// not cached",
