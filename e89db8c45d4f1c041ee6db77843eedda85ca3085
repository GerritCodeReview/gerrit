What he was saying: after running gerrit under stress: with this specific configuration, as described in the linked Apache SSHD issue: [1]:\n\n  NOTE: in our setup, we can reproduce this quite easily\n  by increasing the parallelism in git-repo,\n  reducing the values of waitTimeout (WAIT_FOR_SPACE_TIMEOUT),\n  rekeyBytesLimit (REKEY_BYTES_LIMIT)\n  and rekeyTimeLimit (REKEY_TIME_LIMIT) configuration options.\n\nthe deadlock was showing up 30 minutes later. First 29 minutes no deadlock, then deadlock occured and gerrit must be re-started.\n\n\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-966",
