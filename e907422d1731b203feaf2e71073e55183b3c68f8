Or more like a warning and an error message. I was a bit lazy to do deep research into this, so I just guessed that the second means that I\u0027m lacking asciidoctor. (Might be completely wrong guess.) Anyway, I tried installing the asciidoctor gem in jruby, but apparently there is some bug in the gem installer that results in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. That frustrated me, so I gave up and checked with the things that did work.",

      "message": "I only get asciidoctorj and not asciidoctor-java-integration. However, if I understand I1f5ba30815 correctly, it shouldn\u0027t be needed anymore. Or is that the point, that other people have the integration thing lying around in their caches and I don\u0027t and therefore it doesn\u0027t work? Probably not. I tried to check it anyway. First by just adding back the old dependency in the BUCK file. Building failed with some kind of OutOfMemoryError. Then I went back before that change and tried to build, which also gives me errors.\n\nThis is quite frustrating. Lots of guessing around to correct a fairly unimportant problem. (I\u0027d want to guess less, but I don\u0027t know where to look without investing a lot of time.)",
