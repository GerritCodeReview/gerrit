      "message": "Actually, I have plans to rework all of the diff caches and move away from JGit\u0027s Edit to a custom object (see below in the commit message). Originally, I had hoped that I could implement it at the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, I won\u0027t find enough time for it soon. Since I delayed the fixes for the false negatives already long enough (those bugs have been bugging me for some months), I decided to at least get in a decent bug fix now and fix it in a more elegant way when I find time for the proper rework.\n\nBy the way, I really don\u0027t want to extend JGit\u0027s Edit. Our ReplaceEdit is already confusing enough and I don\u0027t think that Edit was designed in a way to be extended. In addition, JGit\u0027s Edits are mutable, which is very sub-optimal, especially since we cache those values.",

      "message": "Thanks for clarifying. A BIG +1 to drop dependency on JGit\u0027s Edit class altogether. For GWT we even doing realy, realy, ugly hacks, like patching JGit classes in Gerrit tree, and for doing it we remove signatures from JGit final artifacts fetched from Maven Central. That\u0027s all a huge mess. I wonder, if I could allocate some time to get rid of JGit\u0027s Edit in Gerrit tree, would you be able to help with reviews?",
