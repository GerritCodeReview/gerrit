      "message": "Actually, I have plans to rework all of the diff caches and move away from JGit\u0027s Edit to a custom object (see below in the commit message). Originally, I had hoped that I could implement it at the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, I won\u0027t find enough time for it soon. Since I delayed the fixes for the false negatives already long enough (those bugs have been bugging me for some months), I decided to at least get in a decent bug fix now and fix it in a more elegant way when I find time for the proper rework.\n\nBy the way, I really don\u0027t want to extend JGit\u0027s Edit. Our ReplaceEdit is already confusing enough and I don\u0027t think that Edit was designed in a way to be extended. In addition, JGit\u0027s Edits are mutable, which is very sub-optimal, especially since we cache those values.",
