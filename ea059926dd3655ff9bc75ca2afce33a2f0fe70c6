      "message": "I would like to see a validation test for this scenario, which seems very easy to reproduce looking at your issue.\n\nI am quite surprised that we never realised that WorkQueue had that problem, I am wondering what are the E2E implications for the Gerrit use-cases that are using the WorkQueue with the scheduling at fixed rates.\n\nCan you mention at least one in your ticket?",

      "message": "I am concerned that adding this without a delay will result in full CPU \"spinning\" for thread B if there are no other tasks to be executed while thread A is blocked (say sleeping). In this scenario, I picture that thread B is basically in a fast loop of:\n\n1) get next task from queue, \n2) task is still running, so\n3) add task back into queue\n\nThus I think it is important to ensure that it has some delay which is no larger than the original task\u0027s \"interval\" when resubmitting the task to the queue.",
