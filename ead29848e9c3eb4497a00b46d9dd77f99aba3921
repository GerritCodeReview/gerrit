      "message": "Yes, I was first thinking to use the OnEditEnabler, but there was a tiny detail which I did not like about it. When the user enters something the button gets enabled, but when the user then clears the textbox the button does not get disabled again. So it\u0027s still possible to click the button if no group name is provided. Well, maybe it\u0027s a too minor thing too worry about.",
