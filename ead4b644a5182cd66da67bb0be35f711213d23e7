      "message": "\u003e I\u0027m not sure what problem we are trying to solve here.\n\nThe first question I get from users that see the new change screen for the first time is: \"Where do I see at which patch set I\u0027m currently looking?\"\n\nAt the moment this information is not directly displayed on ChangeScreen2. One either needs to open the revision popup or find the patch set number in the URL (if it is not the current patch set).\n\nAs suggested place for showing the patch set number, people say it should be in the header or in the header of the files table. Since the space in the header is rare I didn\u0027t want to put it there, but was looking for another place where it would be fitting.\n\nUsing \"PS\" for \"patch set\" is actually bad. I heard already many opinions that this abbreviation is not obvious and we should rather write \"patch set\". So I would actually change this too (if the available space allows it).",
