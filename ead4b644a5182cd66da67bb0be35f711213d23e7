      "message": "\u003e I\u0027m not sure what problem we are trying to solve here.\n\nThe first question I get from users that see the new change screen for the first time is: \"Where do I see at which patch set I\u0027m currently looking?\"\n\nAt the moment this information is not directly displayed on ChangeScreen2. One either needs to open the revision popup or find the patch set number in the URL (if it is not the current patch set).\n\nAs suggested place for showing the patch set number, people say it should be in the header or in the header of the files table. Since the space in the header is rare I didn\u0027t want to put it there, but was looking for another place where it would be fitting.\n\nUsing \"PS\" for \"patch set\" is actually bad. I heard already many opinions that this abbreviation is not obvious and we should rather write \"patch set\". So I would actually change this too (if the available space allows it).",

      "message": "\u003eSince the space in the header is rare I didn\u0027t want to put it there\n\nHow is replacing currently shown:\n\n \"Not current\"\n\nwith \n\n \"Patch Set 42\"\n\nis a matter of spaces? Because \"not current\" tries to tell me that i am not on the latest ps, failing to tell me exactly on what ps i am now. Because it is very important information it belongs to the Header.\n\nActually it was already in change header, if you would check the very first version of CS2 that was merged to master: Revisions was implemented as a list box and \"1: 4711\" was shown.\n\nLater it was changed to drop down, to include more information but the current ps was lost.\n\nRecently keyboard bindings were added to switch between ps in Revisions.\nSo that we clearly have to show the ps on CS2. At least on Files section header like suggested in this change. Or like i suggested on the change header.\n\n\n\u003e Using \"PS\" for \"patch set\" is actually bad. I heard already many opinions that this abbreviation is not obvious and we should rather write \"patch set\".\n\n+1 to replace PS abbreviation with Patch Set like it was on the old change string.",
