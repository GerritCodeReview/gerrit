      "message": "This is about the rebase from the WebUI. The commit message that implemented this feature [1] actually says that useContentMerge \u003d true was intended. I think this makes sense since after rebasing a commit from the UI, the commit will still be reviewed. For the merge strategies it is more critical if content merge is used since here nobody can review the commit anymore, hence the project setting.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/32431",
