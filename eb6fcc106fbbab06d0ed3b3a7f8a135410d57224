      "message": "Not according to the documentation:\n\n  Run a test server:\n  \n  ```sh\n  buck build polygerrit \u0026\u0026 \\\n  java -jar buck-out/gen/polygerrit/polygerrit.war daemon\n\nthat guarantees, that the file is there.\n\nBut the point is: the build toolchain should always try to separate concerns: either you are bothering about your deps or your are developing interactively your application and try to offer optimized change-[compile]-re-deploy cycle. You should never ever mix these modes and try to do all this in one run.\n\nI also don\u0027t buy the correctness argument. With the current toolchain, when I change JGit version and reload polygerrit in browser, then this change wouldn\u0027t be reflected. The definition of this mode is: the build is disabled, because we are developoing Javascript application and thanks Buck, that maintains for us mirrored soure tree in buck-out directory, we don\u0027t have to do anything.\n\nWhat if a new javascript source file is added? Would this change be reflected, without stopping the runnig container and re-invoking:\n\n  buck build polygerrit \u0026\u0026 \\\n  java -jar buck-out/gen/polygerrit/polygerrit.war daemon\n\n?",
