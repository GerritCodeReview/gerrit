      "message": "I agree this would be nicer. I played around with a few options for refactoring this and I personally would go even further with a return type of `Element | undefined`. However, both that and your suggestion are incompatible to the current return type and would require us to also change call sites.\n\nSince this method is also public (and I don\u0027t fully understand to whom) I decided to go with narrowing the existing type in a compatible fashion.\n\nHowever, right now I\u0027m not even sure if I\u0027ll need this for an upcoming implementation. That\u0027s why I did not yet request review.",
