      "message": "canRebase() was removed from ETag computation on /changes/\u003cid\u003e/detail in: [1], with this justification:\n\n  The change ETag should be based on the change metadata itself, not\n  the branch it is targeting. Running an inmemory rebase every time\n  we need to compute the ETag is too heavy weight for If-None-Match.\n\nWhy is this the right thing to do on /changes/{id}/revisions/{sha}/actions what was wrong thing to do on /changes/\u003cid\u003e/detail?\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/69651",
