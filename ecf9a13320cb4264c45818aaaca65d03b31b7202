The bigger change is that you\u0027re completely changing the semantics of the tab.\n\nI don\u0027t think it is necessarily appropriate to get rid of the \"same topic\" tab just yet. For hosts without submitWholeTopic (which is, remember, almost all of our *.googlesource.com hosts), \"Submitted Together\" will be a subset of \"Related Chagnes\". And on those hosts, users might still want to know what changes are in the same topic even if they\u0027re not submitted together.",

But that\u0027s also not a good idea as we already have so many tabs there.\n\nMaybe we can move the \"same topic\" functionality into the \"related changes\" tab?\n\nI would like to transform the two \"related changes\"/\"same topic\" tabs into a \"fuzzily related changes\" and \"exact changes which would submit together\".\nAnd if we have disabled submission of a whole topic, then the topic itself is also just a fuzzy indicator that these changes are related.",

      "message": "I think the state of these tabs after this specific change is a usability regression on sites when submitWholeTopic is false. It\u0027s pointless to have two tabs \"Related Changes\" (using the current GetRelated implementation) and \"Submitted Together\" in that case. Additionally, I think \"Same Topic\" is still useful.\n\nYou are thinking ahead, which is good. I think \"related changes\" being fuzzy and \"submitted together\" being exact is a good plan, in both submitWholeTopic cases.\n\nBut the intermediate state in this change is not so good.",
