      "message": "I agree this is a good suggestion.  Would you be agreeable to holding off on that change until after this gets in?  I think it is OK to delay on this for a couple reasons -\n\n* It will be very rare that a plugin fails to enable - it had to be enabled at one point in order to be disabled.  Broken plugins cannot be disabled.\n* It will be rare that an admin will call this interface with more than one plugin specified (imo)\n* The disable command uses the same logic and could use the same fix (although - I admit it is more likely to have a failure when enabling vs disabling)",
