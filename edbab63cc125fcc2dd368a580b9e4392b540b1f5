The call is successful and the result is that the previous registration which was done at line 51 is overridden.\n\nSo if we then call:\n\n EventTypes.getClass(\u0027test-event\u0027);\n\n, it returns `AnotherTestEvent.class` instead of `TestEvent.class`.\n\nThe question is what is the actual expected behaviour here?  should it fail, or should it silently override the previous registration?",
