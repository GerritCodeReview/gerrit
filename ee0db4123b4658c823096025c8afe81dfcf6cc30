      "message": "I would prefer naming the label just \u0027Master-Approval\u0027 as this is what an apprentice will see in the UI:\n\n Need Master-Approval.\n\nHowever, why not put the name of the Master in the label name? Then, someone looking at the change immediately knows who is the master:\n\n Need Master-Yoda-Approval.\n\nI am not sure if we can get the name of the master from an user/1 term. If not we could add a predicate for that. This would, however, be out of scope of the stable-2.5 branch.",
