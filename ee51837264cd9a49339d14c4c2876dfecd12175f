      "message": "Note for reviewers: I was trying to upgrade to rules_nodejs 2.0.0 that removed install_bazel_dependencies() machinery. As Alex Eagle said: \"we donâ€™t believe in bazel dependencies ;-)\".\n\nHowever, after the upgrade polymer linting tests were failing, so that I rebased this change out of the rules_nodejs series and marked the series as WIP. I also wrote this issue: [1].\n\nOnce: [1] is fixed, and we upgrade to rules_nodejs 2.0.0, we can move that block again (or part of it).\n\n[1] https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1977",
