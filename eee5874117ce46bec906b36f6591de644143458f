Fix suggestions for the new path wouldn\u0027t make sense but we should ensure that Gerrit fails in the expected way.\nFor human comments, I had been wondering whether publishing draft comments works for the patch-set-level ones. I guess so, but it would be helpful to document that in a test. Does deletion work for patch-set-level comments? Is it possible to reply to a patch-set-level comment?\nWhat happens if a diff for the new magic file name is requested, or its file content?\n\nI understand that by choosing to use a magic file name, most aspects should work out of the box. The *IT tests are our safety belt, though, and should ensure that supported use cases are working as expected. Of course, we need to find a good balance as not every aspect for comments needs to be covered for patch-set-level comments again.",
