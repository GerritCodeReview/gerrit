      "message": "\u003e\u003e I probably will enforce this rule before the fixit week :)\nMay be let\u0027s do it after the fixit week or at least let\u0027s discuss it in the chat?\nI suppose, it will require additional efforts every time when a new interface is defined. Writing a good JSDoc comments can take even more time than converting a code. And then we should review all comments as well - it slow down us more.\nI suggest to focus only on JS-\u003eTS migration next week and improve JSDoc/TSDoc comments separately.\n\nFor example, for this enum I can write a short comments like \"AuthType - defines authentication type\", but it doesn\u0027t give any additional information to a reader.",

      "message": "ya i agree, `authentication type used when sending requests` is a good one I would say.\n\npersonally I think it might be easier to add comments when define them compared to add them all later since you have better context when you define it, the description can just be why you want to introduce this enum and why it needs to be exported.\n\nI am fine with delaying it if it may slow down the migration consider we don\u0027t really have good documentation habit in the code base (might a good argument for adding that ;) ). I believe this is also a requirement within google, but ya doesn\u0027t necessary need to be one for open source.",
