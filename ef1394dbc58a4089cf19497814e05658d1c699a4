      "message": "I\u0027m also still fine with the name PluginEntry. A plugin usually implements multiple extension points. This means the plugin is a container for these extension point implementations, which you can see as entries in the plugin.\n\nI\u0027m not too much sold on this name, but I think the proposed alternatives are not that much better:\n\n- PluginData: is a very generic name which could mean anything, from this name I would expect that there is only one PluginData per plugin, but not multiple\n- PluginMetadata: this is not meta data about the plugin, but rather meta data about extension point implementations in the plugin\n- Extension: I think this is a good name and describes best what this is, but we already have extensions vs. plugins, then it\u0027s confusing that a plugin contains \"extensions\" now\n- ExtensionPoint: We already use this name for the interfaces in Gerrit core that can be implemented by plugins\n\nIf you still feel PluginEntry is bad, I would probably go for \u0027Extension\u0027 instead (despite of the name conflict).",
