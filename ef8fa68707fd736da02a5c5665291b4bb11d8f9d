      "message": "We already added the field with change https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/324552.\n\nI think the reason was that, in ChangeQueryBuilder we return a predicate (fieldName, Value) that is matched against the index docs. Previously we had:\nis:submittable \u003d (Field.SubmitRecord, OK) \n            AND !(Field.SubmitRecord, NOT_READY)\n            AND !(Field.SubmitRecord, RULE_ERROR)\n\nThe predicate is transformed to a query that can run against the index backend (example for Lucene in [1]). The conversion is based on the field name and value.\n\nFor submit requirements, we define them as a stored field, so we can\u0027t use them to query the index (AFAIU). So the alternative would be to add another non-stored field for submit_requirement and query them with the same way we do for submit records:\nis:submittable \u003d (Field.SubmitRequirement, SATISFIED) OR (.. OVERRIDDEN) ..\n            AND !(Field.SubmitRequirement, UNSATISFIED), etc...\n\nI found it easier though to have a issubmittable field {0, 1} instead.\n\nBack to your question: we haven\u0027t added a change to allow querying changes with a submit requirement status, but we can add that in a later change.\n\n[1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/80014c4c73ab6821dd6bad33a08ffbd1d647cabb/java/com/google/gerrit/lucene/LuceneChangeIndex.java#310",
