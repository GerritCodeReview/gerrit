We have to support the state where some changes have NoteDb primary and some changes have ReviewDb primary. That means that the implementation of update(Colllection) has to first look up changes in that list to see which ones have ReviewDb primary, and call delegate.update() only for the ones that do.\n\nEventually we will swap out ReviewDb#changes, but only once we no longer need to support mixed ReviewDb/NoteDb primary in the same server.",

      "message": "One problem that generally arises with \"Post Mortem Analyse\" approach is that you never know how you got there: no rows in the database. We disabled the db during secondary index integration to avoid touching the database altogether when reading changes and expecting there is no any database interaction. I did similar database disabling approach for unit tests here, and it turns out, there are still some database operations including inserts and rollbacks at this point and reading database sequences (it\u0027s clear, it\u0027s not ready yet, though): [1].\n\nIdeally, we could set up partialy disabled ReviewDb for unit tests in primary storage NoteDb mode case, until accounts and Groups stuff is not migrated to NoteDb. So that database read (including sequence retrieval) and write operations only blocked for change entity group, but still work for account and group entities.\n\n* [1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/593381",

      "message": "I considered that, but the reason I didn\u0027t take that approach was that it\u0027s a bit of work to build that partial ReviewDb properly. You have to keep track of which entities have been inserted and then throw the appropriate exception during commit(). Not impossible, but this was much easier, and in practice I didn\u0027t have a hard time tracking down the few failures there were.",
