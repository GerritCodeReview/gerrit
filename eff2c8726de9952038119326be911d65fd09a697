      "message": "Unrelated to this change, but instead of using list coprehension here and thus doing something in-natural, how about to do the same I did for Lucene query tests, and move the build file to their own packages:\n\n* account\n* change\n* group\n* project\n\ne.g.: [1]. This would somplify the build fiel and move the BUILD definition to the actual test file sources. And this would be consitent to how Lucene tests are defined.\n\n* [1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/eff2c8726de9952038119326be911d65fd09a697/javatests/com/google/gerrit/server/query/account/BUILD",
