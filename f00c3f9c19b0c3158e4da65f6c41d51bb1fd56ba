Most actions on a revision make no sense on an edit (/review, /submit, etc.). The state of an edit is different from that of a revision, its mutable and can change. An edit is private to the user drafting it (right now anyway), while a revision is public to the reviewers. An edit doesn\u0027t really need to carry around the idea of an uploader or the timestamp, while a revision does. Etc.",
