      "message": "I don\u0027t want to overload the cookbook plugin with too much stuff. I think it\u0027s enough to have one example for each category. How to consume a JavaScript object in a plugin is already shown by [1]. Technically it is the same whether it is ChangeInfo, AccountPreferencesInfo, ProjectInfo, ... I think adding an example for each *Info class would do more damage to the cookbook plugin than it would be useful.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/69511",

      "message": "Thanks. Now I see it, old applyUserPreferences() is doing that. I also saw, that in the follow-up change you removed account from host page data servlet, but in this change the GeneralPreference part of it isn\u0027t used any more, right? Can it be partially removed from host page data already in this change, so that no preferences are transported over the wire to the client, when they aren\u0027t used any more? But probably this is a hack one would be removed in this series anyway, but what I mean is to do in HostPageServlet.doGet() something like:\n\n  if (user.isIdentifiedUser()) {\n      Account a \u003d ((IdentifiedUser) user).getAccount();\n      w.write(HPD_ID + \".account\u003d\");\n      AccountGeneralPreferences rememberMe \u003d a.getGeneralPreferences();\n      a.setGeneralPreferences(null);\n      json(a, w);\n      a.setGeneralPreferences(rememberMe);\n      [...]",
