      "message": "It\u0027s good that this is added here, but my point was actually an opposite one: How should gerrit users find this documentat? My suggestion is: should this document be migrated to asciidoc, like the rest of gerrit documentation in Documentation directory and include the generated document in index.txt, and have both links during transition period, something like:\n\n* .. link:user-inline-edit.html[Manipulating Changes in Browser (Old UI)]\n* .. link:user-inline-edit-pg.html[Manipulating Changes in Browser (Neu UI)]\n\nOr do you have a different plan to make this document accessible? I think we should preserve the old documentation unless the old UI is removed. What I would like to avoid is replace the old UI documentation with the new UI before the old UI was actually removed.",
