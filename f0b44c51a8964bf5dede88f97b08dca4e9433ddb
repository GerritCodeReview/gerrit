I want to detail that user journey in this document, and I\u0027d rather not add what would have to be a whole series of screenshots to detail a more rare case.",

      "message": "It\u0027s good that this is added here, but my point was actually an opposite one: How should gerrit users find this documentat? My suggestion is: should this document be migrated to asciidoc, like the rest of gerrit documentation in Documentation directory and include the generated document in index.txt, and have both links during transition period, something like:\n\n* .. link:user-inline-edit.html[Manipulating Changes in Browser (Old UI)]\n* .. link:user-inline-edit-pg.html[Manipulating Changes in Browser (Neu UI)]\n\nOr do you have a different plan to make this document accessible? I think we should preserve the old documentation unless the old UI is removed. What I would like to avoid is replace the old UI documentation with the new UI before the old UI was actually removed.",

Say in a couple of weeks/months, stable-2,16 is cut of from the master. How should gerrit user from specific gerrit site installations be able to access this documentation. To give you example, how it is working today, check this WMF links for index and user-inline-edit tutorial [1], [2]. I would expect, that given that in 2.16 inline edit in PG is ready, the Gerrit users would greatly benefit from this PG specific Workthrough documentation if they would be able to browse it in the same way, like the rest documentation in gerrit site.\n\n* [1] https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/Documentation/index.html\n* [2] https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/Documentation/user-inline-edit.html",
