If a change requires cleanup/refactoring, it is best to do that cleanup in a preparatory, separate change. If during a review for a functional change, a related cleanup/refactoring is discovered, it is OK to do this in a follow-up change to avoid additional churn on the change under review, even though technically it is preferable to do the cleanup first.",
