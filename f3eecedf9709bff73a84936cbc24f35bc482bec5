      "message": "Is it actually possible for a plugin to register a REST endpoint under its own namespace? E.g. could the plugin delete-projects register a REST endpoint under /plugins/delete-project/projects/\u003cproject-name\u003e for deleting projects that is not available under /plugins/\u003cany-other-plugin\u003e/projects/\u003cproject-name\u003e? How would a plugin register such a REST endpoint? At the moment the delete-project plugin is registering its REST endpoint under /projects/\u003cproject-name\u003e [1]. I\u0027m wondering now whether this was a good idea if to take into consideration that it might clash one day with another Gerrit core REST endpoint.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/49148",
