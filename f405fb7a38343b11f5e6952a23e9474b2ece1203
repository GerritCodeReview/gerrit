      "message": "1. This breaks the consistency of gr-navigation. *All* getUrl... methods return a relative URL, but not this one? Maybe let the caller call a function in url-util.ts (which needs to created first) that converts a relative path into an absolute URL string.\n\n2. I think the best way is use `new URL(path, window.location.href).toString()`. Note that `path` needs a leading slash. Note that `window.location.href` could also `document.baseUri`, not sure which one is the better choice. Note that `.toString()` is the same as `.href` for URLs.",
