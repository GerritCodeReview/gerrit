      "message": "I thought this lag was only between the info/refs request (plus unlocking the gpg key) and sending the command list, and that computing the revwalk would happen after that. Is that not the case?\n\nAnyway I\u0027m happy to increase this to 10 minutes or an hour or something; how high is too high?",

      "message": "No. Look at GIT_CURL_VERBOSE\u003d1 git push ... on a complex repo with no bitmaps, e.g. Linux kernel. It will be about a minute between the time the /info/refs request ends and the next request starts.\n\nAfter counting and delta compression we send a tiny 4 byte payload, then start sending the real payload. But you must get through counting and delta compression within the nonce slop.\n\nThat makes pushing a large repository with signed push harder. Client needs to get through the entire local computation process before the nonce slop ends. :(\n\n5 minutes is good enough for Kerberos. I think we could do 5 minutes by default and reasonably explain that to people. It also should fit many common larger repositories local computation time.",
