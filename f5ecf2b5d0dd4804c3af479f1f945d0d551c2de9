      "message": "Thanks Leo for change. I agree it would be nice to have better previews for gerrit, but as Ben and Edwin commented it needs to make sure that it doesn\u0027t decrease performance. \n\nThe first index is very important - we start to download js files only after this. Do you think it is possible to create title after page is rendered? Will it be parsed by search engines or messangers?\n\nBtw. I think *googlesource have robots.txt set so this host wouldn\u0027t benefit much from this, since it blocks search engines.",

They just download the page and look for the meta/OpenGraph tags. So yes, it unfortunately has to be rendered server-side.\n\nI\u0027ll abandon this change. How would you feel about doing it conditionally for a hardcoded list of known user agents?",

      "message": "Some thoughts on how to approach the latency trade off:\n\n- Detect link preview bots and serve a static site just for them. Unfortunately, there is no standard way of identifying them other than by making a list of known user agents. Maintaining a list doesn\u0027t sound great, but otherwise, this would be my preferred solution - zero cost for the SPA, and it would us add more features over time (like Open Graph snippets or including parts of the commit message).\n\n- Make it configurable so users can pick their poison. Not great since it would lead to an inconsistent user experience.\n\n- Fetch /detail and prefetch it - the frontend fetches that anyway so at least don\u0027t pay the cost twice.\n\n(happy to move the discussion to the issue/repo-discuss/elsewhere - I\u0027m aware that submitting a CL without getting sign-off on the overall approach first means it might be rejected, I\u0027m OK with that)",
