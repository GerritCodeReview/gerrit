      "message": "I would like to try without headers, as it\u0027s not distinct sections, there is overlapping. I think it would look a little strange to have headers like \u0027Draft and unresolved\u0027, \u0027unresolved\u0027, \u0027resolved and Draft\u0027, \u0027resolved.  We can obviously revisit this if users are confused.\n\nI think the comments visually speak for themselves with the ordering. When I first tried this, I actually had the order slightly differently (had all drafts first), and the different shades of yellow next to each other felt more random.  With this order, all of the darker yellow is on top, all of the light yellow is on bottom and within each section, the drafts are on top.",
