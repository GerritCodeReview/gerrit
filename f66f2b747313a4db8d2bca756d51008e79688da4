I think in most cases it would be better to use ProjectConfig instead. ProjectConfig already has logic to parse project.config and hence is more comfortable to use than the plain JGit Config API.\n\nFYI the existing LabelConfigValidator is using Config rather than ProjectConfig, only because it checks deprecated fields that will be dropped from the ProjectConfig API soon and we still want to keep this validator after the deprecated fields and their API has been removed from ProjectConfig.",
