      "message": "No, not fixing it here. This whole paragraph is just additional motivation for introducing the core.asyncLogginBufferSize parameter and also serves as a reminder on what was causing SSH channel to stop processing requests.\nBasically, we are trying to avoid this whole issue by using sufficiently large core.asyncLogginBufferSize.\n\nWe should also fix the other part of the issue: make the logging events discard-able by not using null as the logger parameter. This will be a follow up change.",
