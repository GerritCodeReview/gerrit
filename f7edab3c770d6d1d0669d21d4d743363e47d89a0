Our initial plan was based on ChangeNotesStateProto, but it wasn\u0027t intended as a public API, so we changed plans\na little. The idea is actually quite simple, and you should get \nthe gist from the commit message. \n\nAlexa is working on the protocol buffer-based differ, and we could open that up, \nbut I\u0027m not sure if that will help your use cases. We\u0027re going to leave the current\nGerrit-internal event system alone.\n",
