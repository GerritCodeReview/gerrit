Is there value in repeating the description in a ChangeMessage as well? I thought the point here was to replace the ChangeMessage with the patch set description.

I don't know that there is or isn't value in it. I assumed that I should leave the existing feature as-is in order to not break anyone's workflow.

Do you think I should remove it?

If we don't include the description in the ChangeMessage, then there is no record in the message log that says what the new description is. I guess the value would be in showing the history of the description for a given patch set.

Let's use change topic as an analogy. If you push a new patch set with a topic, it doesn't mention the topic in the message. But it does add a message each time you change the topic after that. So by that analogy, we should not do it here.

But I'm not sure what the best behavior would be. What do you think?
