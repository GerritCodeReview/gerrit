      "message": "@reviewers: for some reason, all gr-tooltips inside a change list don\u0027t have their arrows aligned properly. I have no clue why this happens, and have tracked it in [1].\n\nIt only looks egregiously bad in this specific use case, because it seems the alignment is offset by some small fixed value and these size indicators are so narrow (usually 1-2ch). Fixing them to a static width in this way helps mitigate the problem for now.\n\n[1] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d8497",
