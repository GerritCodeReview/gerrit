If you do not define any gap between ReviewDb and NoteDb, you would end up with a \"nextChange\" in ReviewDb being +1 vs. NoteDb, which is exactly what this fix is about: avoiding that to happen.\n\nThat is the reason why I changed the test and incremented by 1, because the behaviour changes and we are fine with it.",
