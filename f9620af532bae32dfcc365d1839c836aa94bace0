That\u0027s because the config is not done initializing yet, again at this Init stage.\n\nI\u0027m about to propose a change to no longer (re)throw this exception, but only catch it still and issue the warning below (console and log). But first I want to fully test the change locally this time. Feedback welcome meanwhile if any. We can otherwise wait for the change review.",
