Here are some example commit messages from tests I wrote:\n\n \"Update group\\n\\nAdd: Account 1 \u003c1@example.com\u003e\\nAdd: Account 2 \u003c2@example.com\u003e\\nAdd: group Group x\\nAdd: group Group y\"\n \"Update group\\n\\nAdd: Account 2 \u003c2@example.com\u003e\\n\"\n \"Update group\\n\\n\\nAdd: group Group x\"\n\nNote that in the group case there is an extra newline after the subject, and no trailing newline. (It\u0027s arguably ok for commit messages to not end with newlines, but probably it should be consistent.)",

We can have it either way, I just need to know which is the preferred one. (My code currently doesn\u0027t insert newlines at the end.)",

      "message": "\u003e Regarding the newline at the end: Should commit messages typically end with a newline character or not?\n\nI honestly don\u0027t know what is preferred. If you want it to seem more like a human, then probably add a newline, since that\u0027s what (most?) editor programs will do. But there are plenty of examples in Gerrit today where we set a one-line commit message that does not end in a newline. I don\u0027t think there is a strong reason for that, it\u0027s just more natural in Java to write setMessage(\"Update draft comments\") than setMessage(\"Update draft comments\\n\").",
