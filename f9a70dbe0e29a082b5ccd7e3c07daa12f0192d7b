      "message": "This produces some slightly inconsistent results for members vs. subgroups. Here are some example commit messages from tests I wrote:\n\n \"Update group\\n\\nAdd: Account 1 \u003c1@example.com\u003e\\nAdd: Account 2 \u003c2@example.com\u003e\\nAdd: group Group x\\nAdd: group Group y\"\n \"Update group\\n\\nAdd: Account 2 \u003c2@example.com\u003e\\n\"\n \"Update group\\n\\n\\nAdd: group Group x\"\n\nNote that in the group case there is an extra newline after the subject, and no trailing newline. (It\u0027s arguably ok for commit messages to not end with newlines, but probably it should be consistent.)",

      "message": "This was definitely an error. Having no member/subgroup modifications resulted in empty strings which caused the StringJoiner to insert the delimiters. After I fixed it and adjusted your tests, the commit messages look the way I intended them to be.\n\nRegarding the newline at the end: Should commit messages typically end with a newline character or not? We can have it either way, I just need to know which is the preferred one. (My code currently doesn\u0027t insert newlines at the end.)",
