E.g why are the query operator aliases defined in All-Projects whereas the other aliases are defined in gerrit.config.\n\nFor REST endpoints that are contributed by plugins we also another mechanism. If the view name of the REST endpoint is unique, the prefix with the plugin name can be omitted. Would something similar work here too?\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#ssh-alias\n[2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#urlAlias",
