      "message": "Hm, the only relevant piece in this class is REPOSITORY_SIZE_GROUP, the rest is just wrapping around quota backend methods.\n\nHow about we create QuotaGroupDefinitions in the quota package and put all quota groups there? They can all be public static final strings with a javadoc each\n\nArguable, we could just use an enum there, but I would like to keep the flexibility of a string mainly because then plugins can also call QuotaBackend.",
