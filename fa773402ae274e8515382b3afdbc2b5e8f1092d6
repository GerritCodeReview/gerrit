      "message": "this seems like the wrong approach to me. instead of creating clunky namespaced names to avoid collisions, there should be a central registry of plugins and namespace resources they claim. then you can use short and handy names to start with, and have consistency across gerrit installations.\n\nthis obviously would not cover internal plugins, but your approach just shifts the problem, too: you\u0027ll still need to change your aliases if upstream introduces a collision - unless you remap the new upstream names, but that would border on sadism.",

      "message": "Turns out we were previously relying on a lifecycle starting to create the schema in our tests. That doesn\u0027t work when everything injects a CQB and it needs All-Projects created when the constructor runs.\n\nI need to go back and see if the lifecycle listener can be removed now (assuming no one sees a problem with this approach).",
