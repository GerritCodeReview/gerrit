      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I like this namespace. We are somehow implying the project is a child of the account. That isn\u0027t true.\n\nI think I would have hung this below the project instead of below the account, e.g. one of:\n\n  /projects/MyProject/access?u\u003dself\n  /projects/MyProject/access/self\n\nI think the former makes more sense. The user isn\u0027t really a child of the project either so parsing the access information with a query parameter indicating who the access data should be derived for tells us what we want.",

      "message": "Is createReference a more descriptive name? I\u0027m really on the fence with this name. In the configuration files we call it \"create\" within the [access \"refs/...\"] section so its somewhat clear there. Here create isn\u0027t sufficient on its own.\n\nIn the web UI don\u0027t we call this Create Reference?",
