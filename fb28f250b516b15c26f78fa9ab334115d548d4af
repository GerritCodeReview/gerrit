It seems miss-leading to characterize this as a fix.\n\nI would like to see a policy discussion surrounding these changes, likely a discussion on the mailing list.",

      "message": "OK, but that really isn\u0027t a policy discussion, that is a discussion about this validator.  I am fine with this validator not making the ref check, but I am not fine with the implied policy change.  If this check is going to be removed from here, is it going to be wired in somewhere else?  Ideally it would seem that the refs which call this validator would be configurable somewhere?",
