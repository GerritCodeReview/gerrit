      "message": "Adding changid checking to refs/heads seems like a major policy change which does not seem obviously correct to me.  It seems miss-leading to characterize this as a fix.\n\nI would like to see a policy discussion surrounding these changes, likely a discussion on the mailing list.",

      "message": "OK, but that really isn\u0027t a policy discussion, that is a discussion about this validator.  I am fine with this validator not making the ref check, but I am not fine with the implied policy change.  If this check is going to be removed from here, is it going to be wired in somewhere else?  Ideally it would seem that the refs which call this validator would be configurable somewhere?",

The old code applied the policy in a few exact situations, now it is only applied when some other piece of code in gerrit applies it.  That still seems like a pretty big change and I don\u0027t get the feeling that the implications of this are well understood.\n\nPlease explain the motivation behind this change.   Is it to simply make the validator more generic, or is it to change policy?",
