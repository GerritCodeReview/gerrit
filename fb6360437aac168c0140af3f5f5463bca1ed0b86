The conflict was only the 2 imports so you should keep them both but provider one should come first to respect imports ordering.\n\nI didn\u0027t see this change so I also merged stable-2.9 into stable-2.10 submitted the change but I abandoned it when I saw it conflicted with this one. You can see what I propose for this file in my change: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/59640/1/gerrit-server/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/server/git/strategy/SubmitStrategyFactory.java",
