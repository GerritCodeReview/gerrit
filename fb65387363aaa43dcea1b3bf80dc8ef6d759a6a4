      "message": "I wouldn\u0027t like to see this being done, since the AccountByEmailCache is going away [1]. Instead Accounts.byEmail which is introduced in [2] should be used. Those changes are not merged yet, since internally at Google we have some inconsistent accounts that need to be fixed first. I\u0027m working on this, but it may still take a week or two. If this is not really urgent for you, I would prefer to wait for these changes and then rather make the Accounts class available to Prolog predicates.\n\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/108573\n[2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/109601",
