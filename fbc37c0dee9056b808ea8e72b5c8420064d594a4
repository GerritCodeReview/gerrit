Is there a performance benefit?\n\nI get dozens of review requests per day, some of which get approved by someone else and submitted before I\u0027ve finished (or before I\u0027ve even started) reviewing.  I find it useful to be able to go to the merged changes and see which parts I had already reviewed (if any).",

It only highlights in the middle section \"Incoming reviews\" of your dashboard. So there is no point in the server computing it for closed changes, they won\u0027t show in the middle section.\n\nNow if the UI highlighted elsewhere, then this might make sense to leave available in the JSON data. But it doesn\u0027t right now.",
