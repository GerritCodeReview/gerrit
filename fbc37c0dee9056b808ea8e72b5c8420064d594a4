Is there a performance benefit?\n\nI get dozens of review requests per day, some of which get approved by someone else and submitted before I\u0027ve finished (or before I\u0027ve even started) reviewing.  I find it useful to be able to go to the merged changes and see which parts I had already reviewed (if any).",
