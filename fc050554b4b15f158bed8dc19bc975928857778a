There\u0027s no feature which is broken, just older code which was written with some assumptions in mind. Gal is trying to find a solution which doesn\u0027t involve rewriting all of our email code.\n\nOriginally, we decided that not having a link on \"Patchset\" would be best. We did consider a patchset link as you suggested. Users can add comments on several patchsets, though, and send them within one reply. Hence, there wouldn\u0027t be exactly one patchset we could link to.\n\nThe best alternative we could think of was linking to the \"Comments\" tab. However, robot comments and human comments can be mixed (same as with the example of different patchsets above).",
