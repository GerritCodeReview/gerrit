      "message": "Just as new StringBuilder(\"foo\") is a convenience shortcut for new StringBuilder().add(\"foo\"), checkerFactory.create(user, store) is a convenience shortcut for chekcerFactory.create().setExpectedUser(user).setStore(store)\n\nI tried to cover this in the last sentence of the commit message: \"Also add a convenience method to GerritPublicKeyChecker.Factory for the very common case (particularly in tests) where we do have both an expected user and a store.\"\n\nTo add a little bit more context, what happened in this change is that because we need to look up any revocation keys during checkBasic, we _always_ need a PublicKeyStore on a PublicKeyChecker. So places like the base of this change where we used to just be able to say setExpectedUser (which IMO does not warrant a convenience method), we now have to say both setExpectedUser and setStore. I noticed this was happening enough to save a few lines by adding the convenience method.",
