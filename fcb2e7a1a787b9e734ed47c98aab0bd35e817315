      "message": "Thanks for all of your contributions! I just made this post to Paladox in another change, I\u0027m gonna quote it here. We don\u0027t have an explicit contributor guide or policy for PolyGerrit yet, but...\n\n\u003e We generally aim to have a Monorail bug associated with each change we make, for documentation purposes. It generally consists of making a brief description of the bug, associating it with the correct component (in this case, Polygerrit),\nassigning it a priority, and some other stuff that may or may not be applicable in the future. Would you be willing to adopt this workflow?",

      "message": "My this contribution experience to so far is very long and bumpy, so even if I go through this process, I will think twice next time about submitting more changes. It would help if:\n\n1. I could edit a message here and make it a valid Monorail bug report this way\n2. Some checks are run automatically to say that bug needs to be associated with component\n3. I would not be asked to set a Priority, because I don\u0027t have rights to do it\n\nI don\u0027t see a link to report bug at the bottom of PolyGerrit, and I don\u0027t have time to hunt a correct link for filling a component (because I don\u0027t have rights to change it after), so maybe later. Hopefully, that\u0027s useful.",

We as a team are meeting up the entirety of next week, and one of our goals is to create some sort of contributor guidelines and automatic code checking.\n\nAs to this specific change, I think it\u0027s small enough that it isn\u0027t a big deal. In the future, though, it would be good to have a little bit more description in the commit message, e.g. \u0027Previously, the link to project on the change view linked only open changes.
