Typically the user will not change the commit message.\n\nWhen a project does not have the \"Require Change-Id\" line, it\u0027s possible that the source change doesn\u0027t have a Change-Id line and then cherry-picking to the same branch will not behave in the same way; it will create a new change.\n\nIn this test, there is no Change-Id in the source change, so we have to explicitly set it on the destination change.\n\nActually, I think the addition of this test doesn\u0027t really belong in this change.\n\nFor this change, it should be enough to add an assertion in the `cherryPick` test as I mentioned at line 165.  The tests for cherry picking to the same branch should be added in a separate change, following this one.",
