      "message": "@Kaushik I ported your original change 337374 to stable-3.6 branch, after `gr-message.ts` was migrated to `lit` in change 336816. Thorough review is needed.\n\nAnother option would be to revert this change in this merge series, and upload new implementation to stable-3.6 branch as a new change. In the first patch set of this merge change I did just that, but then figured how to re-implement your fix after `lit` migration. Can you verify that legacy change messages still work as expected with this change?\n\nAdding also Polygerrit maintainers to confirm correct resolution of non trivial conflicts in front end code.\n",
