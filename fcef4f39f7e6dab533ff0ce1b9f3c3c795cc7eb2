      "message": "Jason, in my comment here:\n\nhttps://review.source.android.com/#/c/24720/3/gerrit-reviewdb/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/reviewdb/ChangeMessage.java\n\nI didn\u0027t mean to simply split the schema changes from the rest. There, I asked if addition of PatchSet.Id to the ChangeMessage is related to the introduction of the draft status to the PatchSet and, only in case it isn\u0027t, proposed to split the addition of only the PatchSet.Id from the rest of the change.\n\nOf course, addition of the draft flag to the PatchSet belong to the change:\nhttps://review.source.android.com/#/c/24720\nand it makes no sense to split the schema change for this flag.\n\nIf the addition of PatchSet.Id to the ChangeMessage is also related to the introduction of the draft status then there was no need to split the change at all. It would be enough if you justified that in an answer to my comment.",

      "message": "I agreed that PatchSet.Id in ChangeMessage is not really related specifically to the change of adding a draft status to PatchSet. It\u0027s actually related more to this change: \nhttps://review.source.android.com/#/c/24778/ because when change messages are displayed, they should be hidden if the corresponding patch set is a draft. \n\nInstead of doing 2 separate schema changes, I thought that the easiest thing to do would be to just contain both schema changes in one change and the logic handling draft patchsets and prefiltering change messages in their own changes.",
