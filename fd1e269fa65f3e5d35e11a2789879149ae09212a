      "message": "So /c/X,edit/ means \"edit on change X in edit mode\", while /c/X/edit means \"edit on change X in review mode\"? That\u0027s...odd.\n\nIn a roundabout way, this is kind of an argument for making the action when clicking on a file path in edit mode to go to SBS2. Then we could have /c/X/edit mean \"edit on change X in edit mode\". There would be no such thing as \"edit on change X in review mode\", but that\u0027s not really a problem if you can still get to SBS2.\n\nThat said, I don\u0027t think we should make a UX decision about what happens when you click on a particular link based on it making the URL structure nicer. If having correct behavior means having an ugly URL I think we can live with that. (And anyway we\u0027re not committed to making this particular URL stable, so we can change it later if we think of something better.)",
