      "message": "I don\u0027t want to pass the Project object into the group system. Either the Project.NameKey or a ProjectControl for the current user would be more suitable.\n\nIf we are going to break this interface I wonder if we should first change it to be an abstract base class. Then we can write suggest() as an overloaded method, where the form that takes the project has a concrete implementation that calls the old suggest(String) method by default. Backends that don\u0027t care about the project are then not impacted by such context changes.",
