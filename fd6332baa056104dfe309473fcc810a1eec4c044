In the files backend, this only has to do a read everything under \"refs/users/${USERID}/*\" from the filesystem. That will make it O(#drafts-per-user) rather than O(#users * #drafts-per-user).\n\nif you\u0027re on NFS, that might still be slow, but an NFS filer is like ~1ms per operation, so in total ~25ms  might still be attainable?",

I think Luca is packing loose refs every 15 minutes, so it\u0027s being refreshed at least that often for him.\n\nAlso... some folks on NFS are using trustFolderStat\u003dfalse because directory attributes get aggressively cached on NFS.

I thought we had a RepositoryCache to avoid opening and closing repositories all the time? That is also why I don\u0027t quite understand why it makes sense to build a caching layer on top of the repository (which is what Jacek is doing.)\n\nI don\u0027t know the current state of expected behavior for RepositoryCache.

I know the smaller host we upgraded from 2.11-\u003e3.2 earlier this year (currently) uses trustFolderStat\u003dfalse and had performance regressions, at least some of which are still open issues. This has likely just been a problem for a while, but it\u0027s probably showing up in the All-Users case because the Gerrit design produces many refs in that repo. I\u0027m surprised there wasn\u0027t more discussion/concern back in 2.15 when this happened, but maybe caches there covered it up?\n\nIn general, JGit could certainly be smarter about how it deals with packed-refs (for example, leveraging knowledge of sort order to search without reading the whole file). For NFS specifically, I had some patches a couple years ago that tried to force directory attributes to refresh so we could trust them instead of re-reading packed-refs, but I stopped progress due to some other priorities.\n\nAs excited as I am about reftable, I\u0027m also not sure it solves the problem. Directory attributes are still cached on NFS and the largest reftable file likely won\u0027t be any smaller on disk than the current packed-refs file. Does that code have tricks to avoid reading the whole file?\n\nI\u0027m hoping to start some very intensive performance QA in about 6 months and I\u0027m expecting to find problems in this general area. It\u0027s also possible we\u0027ll have to solve some of those sooner to get our schema migration + notedb migration + offline reindex time down under 4 hours. Thinking of that, a new schema migration that renames 1000s of refs is not going to be very quick. Avoiding that would be preferred.",

It needs log_{blocksize}(#refs) reads to read the final data; you can tweak the blocksize to reduce the number of accesses if reads are expensive. It never reads the entire file, except when you iterate over the entire ref space.\n\n\u003e In general, JGit could certainly be smarter about how it deals with packed-refs (for example, leveraging knowledge of sort order to search without reading the whole file). \n\nAFAICT, Java supports mmap\u0027d files, (https://howtodoinjava.com/java/nio/memory-mapped-files-mappedbytebuffer/), so you could use the exact same trick used in CGit to avoid reading the entire file. Would still be good to see how much time the file reading costs vs. doing the directory reads, though.\n\n\u003eThe problem is what you mean by \"efficient\": resolving the call in msec? micros? nanos?\n\u003e\n\u003eWhen you are on NFS and have set trustFolderStat \u003d false, JGit does a filesystem access (*at least* msec if not sometimes sec-level latency) to check if the file has changed. That is never going to be a \"caching\" behaviour, unfortunately.\n\nJGit does this trickery this to account for other processes that write into the same storage. \n\nI think Jacek is trying to introduce a cache that is triggered by ref updates from inside Gerrit, but that only works if Gerrit is the only process writing into repository. If you know that to be the case, I think you could simply also stop overriding trustFolderStat for that repository? I am assuming that in a single-writer (ie. Gerrit) scenario, the same process gets a consistent result from reading back its own writes.",
