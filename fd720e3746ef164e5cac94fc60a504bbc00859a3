Maybe storing this is required in some other index implementations.",

      "message": "mmm OK, thanks for explaining. I was just wondering if, e.g. these fields are not stored, how do we know when we display the dashboard that a change is WIP or private?\n\nMaybe since these fields are queryable, we just query for `is:private` or `is:wip` and what we get is treated as private or wip respectively, but the actual retrieved change data does not contain this boolean.\n\nSGTM.",
