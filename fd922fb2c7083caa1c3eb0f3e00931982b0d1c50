      "message": "(Optional) FWIW, I think it\u0027s a bit ugly that this method is exposed at all - the name at least seems to indicate it was originally meant to be an event handler, not a public method. You could use this opportunity to make this private, and create a new, public method with a better name for the use case of manually reinitializing from the outside. Did you check if _updateStops() is actually needed in the scenario where you call this from the outside?",
