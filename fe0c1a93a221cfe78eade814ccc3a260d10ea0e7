      "message": "The xdocs plugin fails to show the diff for the very first change in a project, because it compares commit ID X with its parent X^1 and X^1 does not exist. So the idea was to use the REST endpoint with X^1 to check whether a parent commit exists. However I found that this is not needed. I will simply retrieve the CommitInfo for X and then check the parent information that is contained in the CommitInfo. hence I will abandon this change.",
