      "message": "I think it is kind of related, but the warning can be still addressed. The suppression for `JavaUtilDate` is `@SuppressWarnings(\"JavaUtilDate\")`. See [1].\n\nI think it is referring to the fact that at the moment the JGit class is still using Date [2]. However, with my change the `JavaUtilDate` will go away.\n\n[1]: https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JavaUtilDate\n[2]: https://gerrit.googlesource.com/jgit/+/74fa245b3c3ccf13afcbec7911c7c8459e48527d/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/PersonIdent.java#340",

The only consideration against it, is to avoid non trivial changes on very stable branches. However, given that Edwin\u0027s fix is included starting from stable-3.7 branch I would consider the fix as very good tested.\n\nStill I would defer the decision to @Luca, in his role as Gerrit Release Manager for Gerrit 3.6.x release line.\n\n[1]: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/189192",
