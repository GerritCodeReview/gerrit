One example of ease of reading: when you look at this change in Gerrit, for example at line 32 below, long lines may be wrapped in the middle of words.\n\nIn the docs I don\u0027t think we\u0027re super consistent on the number of columns in a line. Anything from 70-80 is probably fine. If you have no opinions, pick 80.",

The supported way to switch between branches is `git checkout --recurse-submodules`, and this section could just be one sentence, saying exactly that. But instead, we have all this rigmarole about how to get yourself *out* of this situation if you did something other than the supported thing.\n\nMaybe there is a place for that kind of troubleshooting documentation, but maybe not in one of the top 3 sections of the introductory developer documentation.",
