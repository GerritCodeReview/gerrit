      "message": "I am all for making it very clear that a maintainer has done something truly bad, and I certainly don\u0027t want them being removed for political reasons. Your response here makes me wonder if there might be a communication gap here?  Malicious is defined as \"characterized by malice; intending or intended to do harm.\". I find it hard to imagine that we could get all the current existing maintainers to agree that any single Gerrit maintainer has ever made a malicious release yet. I actually think this is the least controversial criteria of all? I we at least agree on the intent here, maybe you could help provide clearer wording?",

      "message": "If you (for arguments sake) made a release, and that release unfortunately had a serious bug, how would you defend if someone claimed that you \"intended to do harm\"? You can\u0027t. No-one can disprove intent since it is not measurable.\n\nAs I stated in my reply I think this is basically a good idea, there should be a clear process for removing a maintainer.\n\nFrom previous discussions i gather that this change is made as a protection for maintainers. Adding specific, loosely defined, criteria for removal has the opposite effect IMO.\n\nIf you feel that it is important to keep these criteria, and maintain protection for maintainers, you will need to add paragraphs such as:\n\n    It is the responsibility of the accuser to prove malicious intent\n\nand\n\n    In this context \"intentionally bypassing\" refers to...\n\netc.\n\nSo far these are guidelines and process descriptions, do we really need legally binding documents?",

      "message": "At a first glance this might seem like a clear-cut criteria for removing a maintainer but what is considered \"abusive language\" and \"behavior\" is extremely individual and context dependent. We are operating in one of the extreme epicentres of criticism, a community were everyone is passionate about code-review and the benefits of heartfelt honesty and open discussion. I think everyone operating under these conditions for a longer period of time have momentarily (and, I believe, most of the time, inaccurately) felt that they were the object of at least \"abusive language\".\nWhos definition of \"abusive language\" are we supposed to adopt?",
