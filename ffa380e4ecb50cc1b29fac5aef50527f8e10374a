      "message": "I think something like this could be added if a steering committee with such powers to promise a roadmap materializes. For example, if this change merges soon, it could be reasonable to add such language in this section to https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/223472\n\nIn that change, one could also consider changing the language in the first paragraph to only require consensus among the steering committee members. Many things could be different with a steering committee. My goal here is to document a process that would apply today.",
