      "message": "At a first glance this might seem like a clear-cut criteria for removing a maintainer but what is considered \"abusive language\" and \"behavior\" is extremely individual and context dependent. We are operating in one of the extreme epicentres of criticism, a community were everyone is passionate about code-review and the benefits of heartfelt honesty and open discussion. I think everyone operating under these conditions for a longer period of time have momentarily (and, I believe, most of the time, inaccurately) felt that they were the object of at least \"abusive language\".\nWhos definition of \"abusive language\" are we supposed to adopt?",

For example, if this change merges soon, it could be reasonable to add such language in this section to https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/223472\n\nIn that change, one could also consider changing the language in the first paragraph to only require consensus among the steering committee members. Many things could be different with a steering committee. My goal here is to document a process that would apply today.",
