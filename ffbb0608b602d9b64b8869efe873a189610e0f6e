      "message": "@luca.milanesio@gmail.com I think that this change not only improves performance, but also improves understanding of the code, makes it easier to read. When I read this code, I immediately noticed that this check is redundant, since it will always be true when the first two tests are true. However, I wondered if there was some trick to this and I checked for half an hour to see if there was some kind of trick in it and in the end I came to the conclusion that there was no trick here and it was just an unnecessary check. What do you think?",
