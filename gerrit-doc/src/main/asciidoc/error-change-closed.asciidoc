change ... closed
=================

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit or submit a
review label (approval) to a change that is already closed.

When Pushing a Commit
---------------------

This error occurs if you are trying to push a commit that contains
the Change-Id of a closed change in its commit message. A change can
be closed either because it was already submitted and merged or
because it was abandoned.

If the change for which you wanted to upload a new patch set was
already submitted and merged you may want to push your commit as a
new change. To do this you have to remove the Change-Id from the
commit message as explained link:error-push-fails-due-to-commit-message.html[here] and ideally generate a new Change-Id
using the link:cmd-hook-commit-msg.html[commit hook] or EGit. Before pushing again it is also
recommended to do a link:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html[git rebase] to base your commit on the submitted
change. Pushing again should now create a new change in Gerrit.

If the change for which you wanted to upload a new patch set was
abandoned and your new changes overcome the reasons for abandoning
this change you may want to restore the change in the Gerrit WebUI
(browse the abandoned change in the Gerrit WebUI and click on the
'Restore Change' button). Afterwards the push should succeed and a
new patch set for this change will be created.

When Submitting a Review Label
------------------------------

This error occurs if you are trying to submit a review label (approval) using
the link:cmd-review.html[ssh review command] after the change has been closed.
A change can be closed because it was submitted and merged, because it was abandoned,
or because the patchset to which you are submitting the review has been replaced
by a newer patchset.
