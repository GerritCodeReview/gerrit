One or more refs/for/ names blocks change upload
================================================

With this error message Gerrit rejects to push a commit for code
review if the remote git repository has a branch under the
'refs/for/' namespace.

Gerrit uses the 'refs/for/' namespace for magical refs that represent
the review queues for branches in the git repository hosted by
Gerrit. If, for a project, a real branch is created under the
'refs/for' namespace this conflicts with the namespace reserved for
the Gerrit review queues and Gerrit can't accept further pushes for
code review.

To solve this problem all real branches that exist under the
'refs/for/' namespace have to be deleted or renamed in the remote git
repository.

To see which branches exist under the 'refs/for/' namespace a Gerrit
administrator can run the following command:

----
  $ git for-each-ref refs/for
----

If all these branches should be deleted it can be done with the
following command:

----
  $ for n in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname)' refs/for);
    do git update-ref -d $n; done
----

Branches under the 'refs/for/' namespace can be created by users that
bypass Gerrit and push directly to the git repository itself (not
using the Gerrit server's SSH port).
