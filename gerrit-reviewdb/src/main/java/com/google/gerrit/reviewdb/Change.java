/**
 * A change proposed to be merged into a {@link Branch}.
 * <p>
 * The data graph rooted below a Change can be quite complex:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   {@link Change}
 *     |
 *     +- {@link ChangeMessage}: &quot;cover letter&quot; or general comment.
 *     |
 *     +- {@link PatchSet}: a single variant of this change.
 *          |
 *          +- {@link PatchSetApproval}: a +/- vote on the change's current state.
 *          |
 *          +- {@link PatchSetAncestor}: parents of this change's commit.
 *          |
 *          +- {@link PatchLineComment}: comment about a specific line
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <h5>PatchSets</h5>
 * <p>
 * Every change has at least one PatchSet. A change starts out with one
 * PatchSet, the initial proposal put forth by the change owner. This
 * {@link Account} is usually also listed as the author and committer in the
 * PatchSetInfo.
 * <p>
 * The {@link PatchSetAncestor} entities are a mirror of the Git commit
 * metadata, providing access to the information without needing direct
 * accessing Git. These entities are actually legacy artifacts from Gerrit 1.x
 * and could be removed, replaced by direct RevCommit access.
 * <p>
 * Each PatchSet contains zero or more Patch records, detailing the file paths
 * impacted by the change (otherwise known as, the file paths the author
 * added/deleted/modified). Sometimes a merge commit can contain zero patches,
 * if the merge has no conflicts, or has no impact other than to cut off a line
 * of development.
 * <p>
 * Each PatchLineComment is a draft or a published comment about a single line
 * of the associated file. These are the inline comment entities created by
 * users as they perform a review.
 * <p>
 * When additional PatchSets appear under a change, these PatchSets reference
 * <i>replacement</i> commits; alternative commits that could be made to the
 * project instead of the original commit referenced by the first PatchSet.
 * <p>
 * A change has at most one current PatchSet. The current PatchSet is updated
 * when a new replacement PatchSet is uploaded. When a change is submitted, the
 * current patch set is what is merged into the destination branch.
 * <p>
 * <h5>ChangeMessage</h5>
 * <p>
 * The ChangeMessage entity is a general free-form comment about the whole
 * change, rather than PatchLineComment's file and line specific context. The
 * ChangeMessage appears at the start of any email generated by Gerrit, and is
 * shown on the change overview page, rather than in a file-specific context.
 * Users often use this entity to describe general remarks about the overall
 * concept proposed by the change.
 * <p>
 * <h5>PatchSetApproval</h5>
 * <p>
 * PatchSetApproval entities exist to fill in the <i>cells</i> of the approvals
 * table in the web UI. That is, a single PatchSetApproval record's key is the
 * tuple {@code (PatchSet,Account,ApprovalCategory)}. Each PatchSetApproval
 * carries with it a small score value, typically within the range -2..+2.
 * <p>
 * If an Account has created only PatchSetApprovals with a score value of 0, the
 * Change shows in their dashboard, and they are said to be CC'd (carbon copied)
 * on the Change, but are not a direct reviewer. This often happens when an
 * account was specified at upload time with the {@code --cc} command line flag,
 * or have published comments, but left the approval scores at 0 ("No Score").
 * <p>
 * If an Account has one or more PatchSetApprovals with a score != 0, the Change
 * shows in their dashboard, and they are said to be an active reviewer. Such
 * individuals are highlighted when notice of a replacement patch set is sent,
 * or when notice of the change submission occurs.
