 * Holds the current state of the NoteDb migration.

 * stored in ReviewDb whose key's {@code getParentKey()} method returns null. For an example of the
 * entity hierarchy rooted at Change, see the diagram in {@code
 * com.google.gerrit.reviewdb.client.Change}.
 *
 * <p>During a transitional period, each root entity group from ReviewDb may be either <em>written
 * to</em> or <em>both written to and read from</em> NoteDb.
 *
 * <p>This class controls the state of the migration according to options in {@code gerrit.config}.
 * In general, any changes to these options should only be made by adventurous administrators, who
 * know what they're doing, on non-production data, for the purposes of testing the NoteDb
 * implementation. Changing options quite likely requires re-running {@code RebuildNoteDb}. For
 * these reasons, the options remain undocumented.
