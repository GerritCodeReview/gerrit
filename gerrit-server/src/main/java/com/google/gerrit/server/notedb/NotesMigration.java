/**
 * Current low-level settings of the NoteDb migration for changes.
 *
 * <p>This class only describes the migration state of the {@link
 * com.google.gerrit.reviewdb.client.Change Change} entity group, since it is possible for a given
 * site to be in different states of the Change NoteDb migration process while staying at the same
 * ReviewDb schema version. It does <em>not</em> describe the migration state of non-Change tables;
 * those are automatically migrated using the ReviewDb schema migration process, so the NoteDb
 * migration state at a given ReviewDb schema cannot vary.
 *
 * <p>In many places, core Gerrit code should not directly care about the NoteDb migration state,
 * and should prefer high-level APIs like {@link com.google.gerrit.server.ApprovalsUtil
 * ApprovalsUtil} that don't require callers to inspect the migration state. The
 * <em>implementation</em> of those utilities does care about the state, and should query the {@code
 * NotesMigration} for the properties of the migration, for example, {@link #changePrimaryStorage()
 * where new changes should be stored}.
 *
 * <p>Core Gerrit code is mostly interested in one facet of the migration at a time (reading or
 * writing, say), but not all combinations of return values are supported or even make sense.
 *
 * <p>This class controls the state of the migration according to options in {@code gerrit.config}.
 * In general, any changes to these options should only be made by adventurous administrators, who
 * know what they're doing, on non-production data, for the purposes of testing the NoteDb
 * implementation. Changing options quite likely requires re-running {@code RebuildNoteDb}. For
 * these reasons, the options remain undocumented.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Callers should not assume the values returned by {@code
 * NotesMigration}'s methods will not change in a running server.
