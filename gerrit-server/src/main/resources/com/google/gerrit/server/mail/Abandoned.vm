## Template Type:
## -------------
## This is a velocity template, see: http://velocity.apache.org/
##
## Template File Names and extensions:
## ----------------------------------
## Gerrit will use templates ending in ".vm" but will ignore templates ending
## in ".vm.example".  If a .vm template does not exist, the default internal
## gerrit template which is the same as the .vm.example will be used.  If you
## want to override the default template, copy the .vm.exmaple file to a .vm
## file and edit it appropriately.
##
## Template Purposes;
## -----------------
## The Abandonned.vm template will determine the contents of the email related
## to a change being abandonned. (see also ChangeSubject.vm and
## ChangeFooter.vm).
##
## Template Resources:
## ------------------
## Writting templates for gerrit emails is likely to require some basic
## knowledge of the class structure to be useful, so browsing the source
## code might be necessary.  All outgoing emails have the following
## variables available to them:
##
##  $email          a reference to the class constructing the current email.
##                  With this reference it is possible to call any public
##                  method on the email class.
##
##  $messageClass   a String containing the messageClass
##
##  StringUtils     a reference to the apaache StringUtils class.  This can
##                  be very usefull for formatting strings.
##
##
## All change related emails have the following additional variables available
## to them:
##
##  $change         a reference to the current change object
##
##  $branch         a reference to the bracn of this change
##
##  $projectName    the name of this change's project
##
##  $patchSet       a reference to the current patchSet
##
##  $patchSetInfo   a reference to the current patchSetInfo
##
$fromName has abandoned change $change.key.abbreviate():

#if ($email.coverLetter)
$email.coverLetter

#end
