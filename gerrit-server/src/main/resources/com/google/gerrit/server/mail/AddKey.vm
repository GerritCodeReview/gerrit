## Template Type:
## -------------
## This is a velocity mail template, see: http://velocity.apache.org and the
## gerrit-docs:config-mail.txt for more info on modifying gerrit mail templates.
##
## Template File Names and extensions:
## ----------------------------------
## Gerrit will use templates ending in ".vm" but will ignore templates ending
## in ".vm.example".  If a .vm template does not exist, the default internal
## gerrit template which is the same as the .vm.example will be used.  If you
## want to override the default template, copy the .vm.example file to a .vm
## file and edit it appropriately.
##
## This Template:
## --------------
## The AddKey.vm template will determine the contents of the email
## related to adding a new SSH or GPG key to an account.
##
One or more new ${email.keyType} keys have been added to Gerrit Code Review at ${email.gerritHost}:

#if($email.sshKey)
$email.sshKey
#elseif($email.gpgKeys)
$email.gpgKeys
#end

If this is not expected, please contact your Gerrit Administrators
immediately.

You can also manage your ${email.keyType} keys by visiting
#if($email.sshKey)
$email.gerritUrl#/settings/ssh-keys
#elseif($email.gpgKeys)
$email.gerritUrl#/settings/gpg-keys
#end
#if($email.userNameEmail)
(while signed in as $email.userNameEmail)
#else
(while signed in as $email.email)
#end
