This folder is a literal copy of parts of jmock,
see http://www.jmock.org/ including 
https://github.com/jmock-developers/jmock-library/pull/75

TODO(sbeller): Once this pull request is included into a release,
we want to remove all classes of this directory and replace its
usage with the jmock equivalent org.jmock.lib.concurrent.DeterministicScheduler
class.
