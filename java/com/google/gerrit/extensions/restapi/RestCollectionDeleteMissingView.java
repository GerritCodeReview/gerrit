/**
 * RestView that supports accepting input and deleting a resource that is missing.
 *
 * <p>The RestDeleteMissingView solely exists to support a special case for creating a change edit
 * by deleting a path in the non-existing change edit. This interface should not be used for new
 * REST API's.
 *
 * <p>The input must be supplied as JSON as the body of the HTTP request. Delete views can be
 * invoked by the HTTP method {@code DELETE}.
 *
 * <p>The RestDeleteMissingView is only invoked when the parse method of the {@code RestCollection}
 * throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException}, and hence the resource doesn't exist yet.
 *
 * @param <P> type of the parent resource
 * @param <C> type of the child resource that id deleted
 * @param <I> type of input the JSON parser will parse the input into.
