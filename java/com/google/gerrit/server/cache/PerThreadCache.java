/**
 * Caches object instances for a request as {@link ThreadLocal} in the serving thread.
 *
 * <p>This class is intended to cache objects that have a high instantiation cost, are specific to
 * the current request and potentially need to be instantiated multiple times while serving a
 * request.
 *
 * <p>This is different from the key-value storage in {@code CurrentUser}: {@code CurrentUser}
 * offers a key-value storage by providing thread-safe {@code get} and {@code put} methods. Once the
 * value is retrieved through {@code get} there is not thread-safety anymore - apart from the the
 * retrieved object guarantees. Depending on the implementation of {@code CurrentUser}, it might be
 * shared between the request serving thread as well as sub- or background treads.
 *
 * <p>In comparison to that, this class guarantees thread safety even on non-thread-safe objects as
 * it's cache is tied to the serving thread only. While allowing to cache non-thread-safe objects,
 * it has the downside of not sharing any objects with background threads or executors.
 *
 * <p>Lastly, this class offers a cache, that requires callers to also provide a {@code Supplier} in
 * case the object is not present in the cache, while {@code CurrentUser} provides a storage where
 * just retrieving stored values is a valid operation.
