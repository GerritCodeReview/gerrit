/**
 * Allows plugins to decide whether a change is ready to be submitted or not.
 *
 * <p>For a given {@link ChangeData}, each plugin is called and returns a {@link Optional} of {@link
 * SubmitRecord}.
 *
 * <p>A Change can only be submitted if all the plugins give their consent.
 *
 * <p>Each {@link SubmitRecord} represents a decision made by the plugin. If the plugin rejects a
 * change, it should hold valuable informations to help the end user understand and correct the
 * blocking points.
 *
 * <p>It should be noted that each plugin can handle rules inheritance.
 *
 * <p>This interface should be used to write pre-submit validation rules. This includes both simple
 * checks, coded in Java, and more complex fully fledged expression evaluators (think: Prolog,
 * JavaCC, or even JavaScript rules).
