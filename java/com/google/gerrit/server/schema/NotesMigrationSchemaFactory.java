    // There are two levels at which this class disables access to Changes and related tables,
    // corresponding to two phases of the NoteDb migration:
    //
    // 1. When changes are read from NoteDb but some changes might still have their primary storage
    //    in ReviewDb, it is generally programmer error to read changes from ReviewDb. However,
    //    since ReviewDb is still the primary storage for most or all changes, we still need to
    //    support writing to ReviewDb. This behavior is accomplished by wrapping in a
    //    DisallowedReviewDb.
    //
    //    Some codepaths might need to be able to read from ReviewDb if they really need to,
    //    because they need to operate on the underlying source of truth, for example when reading
    //    a change to determine its primary storage. To support this, ReviewDbUtil#unwrapDb can
    //    detect and unwrap databases of this type.
    //
    // 2. After all changes have their primary storage in NoteDb, we can completely shut off access
    //    to the change tables. At this point in the migration, we are by definition not using the
    //    ReviewDb tables at all; we could even delete the tables at this point, and Gerrit would
    //    continue to function.
    //
    //    This is accomplished by setting the delegate ReviewDb *underneath*
    //    DisallowReadFromChanges to be a complete no-op, with NoChangesReviewDb. With this
    //    stub implementation, all read operations return no results, and write operations silently
    //    do nothing. This implementation is not a public class and callers couldn't do anything
    //    useful with it even if it were.

    // First create the underlying stub.
    checkState(migration.readChanges() && migration.disableChangeReviewDb());
    // Disable writes to change tables in ReviewDb (ReviewDb access for changes are No-Ops); all
    // other table accesses throw runtime exceptions.
    ReviewDb db = new NoChangesReviewDb();

    // Second create the wrappers which can be removed by ReviewDbUtil#unwrapDb(ReviewDb).
    if (migration.readChanges()) {
      // If reading changes from NoteDb is configured, changes should not be read from ReviewDb.
      // Make sure that any attempt to read a change from ReviewDb anyway fails with an exception.
      db = new DisallowedReviewDb(db);
