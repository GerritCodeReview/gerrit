// The mixinBehaviors clears all type information about superClass.
// As a workaround, we define IronFitMixin with correct type.
// Due to the following issues:
// https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/15870
// https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/9944
// we have to import IronFitBehavior in the same file where IronFitMixin
// is used. To ensure that this import can't be avoided, the second parameter
// is added. Usage example:
// class Element extends IronFitMixin(PolymerElement, IronFitBehavior as IronFitBehavior)
// The code 'IronFitBehavior as IronFitBehavior' required, becuase IronFitBehavior
// defined as an object, not as IronFitBehavior instance.

export const IronFitMixin = <T extends Constructor<PolymerElement>>(

  // TODO(TS): mixinBehaviors in some lib is returning: `new () => T` instead
  // which will fail the type check due to missing IronFitBehavior interface
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
