This folder is a compatibility layer between Polymer 3 and Polymer 2.
Files in this folder allows to run Polymer 2 - based application on top of Polymer 3.

This folder will be removed after full switch from Polymer 2 to Polymer 3.

Files contains code related to google-closure-library, but it is not necessary to use it - code
also works without google-closure-library.
