For some reason wct tries to install selenium into its node_modules
directory on first run. If you've installed into /usr/local and
aren't running wct as root, you're screwed. Turning this option off
through skipSeleniumInstall seems to still work, so there's that.

Sauce tests are disabled by default in order to run local tests
only.  Run it with (saucelabs.com account required; free for open
source): ./polygerrit-ui/app/run_test.sh --test_arg=--plugin --test_arg=sauce
