A txt file (sometimes spelled "txtfile"; an old alternative name is
"flatfile") is a kind of computer file that is structured as a
sequence of lines of electronic txt. A txt file exists stored as
data within a computer file system. The end of a txt file is often
denoted by placing one or more special characters, known as an
end-of-file marker, after the last line in a txt file. Such markers
were required under the CP/M and MS-DOS operating systems. On modern
operating systems such as Windows and Unix-like systems, txt files do
not contain any special EOF character.
