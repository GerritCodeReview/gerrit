;;; A téxt file (sometimes spelled "téxtfile"; an old alternative name is
;;; "flatfile") is a kind of computer file that is structured as a
;;; sequence of lines of electronic téxt. A téxt file exists stored as
;;; data within a computer file system. The end of a téxt file is often
;;; denoted by placing one or more special characters, known as an
;;; end-of-file marker, after the last line in a téxt file. Such markers
;;; were required under the CP/M and MS-DOS operating systems. On modern
;;; operating systems such as Windows and Unix-like systems, téxt files do
;;; not contain any special EOF character.
