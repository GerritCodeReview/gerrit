# rollup_bundle - workaround for https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1522
# The ts_library rule ("license-map") transpiles each .ts file to .js file.
# The "license-map" rule includes multiple .ts files and produces multiple output files.
# The nodejs_binary requires only one file as an entry_point. It is expected, that other
# .js files from ts_library are also available, but because of the bug they are not available.
# As a workaround we are using rollup_bundle to group all files together.

# (TODO)dmfilippov Find a better way to fix it (another workaround or submit a bug to
# plugin's authors or to a ts_config rule author).
# The following genrule is a workaround for a bazel intellij plugin's bug.
# According to the documentation, the ts_config_rules section should be added
# to a .bazelproject file if a project uses typescript
# (https://ij.bazel.build/docs/dynamic-languages-typescript.html)
# Unfortunately, this doesn't work. It seems, that the plugin expects some output from
# the ts_config rule, but the rule doesn't produce any output.
# To workaround the issue, the tsconfig_editor genrule was added. The genrule only copies
# input file to the output file, but this is enough to make bazel plugins works.
# So, if you have any problem a typescript editor (import errors, types not found, etc...) -
# try to build this rule from the command line
# (bazel build tools/node_tools/node_modules/licenses:tsconfig_editor) and then sync bazel project
# in intellij.
